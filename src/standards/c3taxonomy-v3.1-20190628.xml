The context and scope for these CIS Capabilities are defined by the capture of NATO's overarching political and military guidance and policies, the identification of mission types and key tasks, the cataloging of needed capabilities, and the description of business processes and their related information products.  Information in this part of the C3 Taxonomy is primarily obtained from the NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) and business process analysis."

In sum, it equips the Alliance for security challenges and guides its future political and military development. A new Strategic Concept was published at the Lisbon Summit in November 2010, reflecting a transformed security environment and a transformed Alliance. New and emerging security threats, especially since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, NATOâ&#128;&#153;s crisis management experience in the Balkans and Afghanistan, and the value and importance of working with partners from across the globe, all drove NATO to reassess and review its strategic posture.   Transformation in the broad sense of the term is a permanent feature of the Organization. Since its inception, NATO has regularly reviewed its tasks and objectives in view of the evolution of the strategic environment. Preparations for the very first Strategic Concept â&#128;&#147; â&#128;&#156;The Strategic Concept for the Defense of the North Atlantic Areaâ&#128;&#157; - started in October 1949. In the course of more than half a century, both the Alliance and the wider world have developed in ways that NATO's founders could not have envisaged. Such changes have been in each and every strategic document that NATO has produced since then."

While reaffirming the basic principles on which the Alliance has rested since its inception, they recognised that the developments taking place in Europe would have a far-reaching impact on the way in which its aims would be met in future. In particular, they set in hand a fundamental strategic review. The resulting new Strategic Concept is available via the provided link."

This paper responds to that tasking. It offers political guidance that NATO should follow when stabilisation and reconstruction requirements are expected to be part of a future operation.   It thus provides the basis for further work to be done by NATO staffs and military authorities in the field of stabilisation and reconstruction, and will also inform NATOâ&#128;&#153;s ongoing HQ and command structure reforms. The guidance should also be used to inform and guide the conduct of current operations.   It should also contribute to and complement the work on the response to the tasking by Heads of State and Government to report at their next Summit on further progress with regard to the implementation of the Comprehensive Approach Action Plan and NATOâ&#128;&#153;s ability to improve the delivery of stabilisation and reconstruction effects as part of the international communityâ&#128;&#153;s efforts and NATOâ&#128;&#153;s intrinsic contribution to a civil-military approach."

At a minimum, NATO Restricted information over the Internet shall be protected in accordance with the NATO Security Policy  and its supporting Directives.

The policy excludes both software that is embedded into hardware systems and Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS) software solutions. For Alliance interoperability it is recommended that Authorities of NATO Nations apply this policy for collective acquisitions.  Within NATO, software management is essential for an efficient and effective Information and Communications Technology (ICT) support for the NATO Enterprise and the Allies.

This Directive includes guidelines for making disposition decisions regarding which records to transfer to a successor body or to the NATO Archives, and which records to destroy. It will also provide procedures for transferring records to a successor body or the NATO Archives.  This Directive is guided by the following principles: * Records identified as essential for current and future business requirements (both active and semi-active records) shall be transferred to the successor body. In the case where here is no designated successor body, these records shall be transferred to the responsible headquarters in the NATO Command structure or to the appropriate office or service or agency at NATO that is responsible for the respective business activity. * Records of permanent value that are no longer required for current and future business (inactive records) shall be transferred to the NATO Archives. * Transfer of records includes change of custodianship. * Records of temporary value that no longer meet current business requirements shall be destroyed in accordance with the NATO Policy on Retention and Disposition and the associated retention schedules, and with due regard to NATO Security Policy.  This Directive supports the NATO Information Management Policy (NIMP) and the Primary Directive on Information Management (PDIM), which describe all aspects of information management at a high level."

The Earth is typically represented through selected topographic, hydrographic, and aeronautical information, or suitable imagery. Such elements must be located within a positional framework. Products are normally delivered as maps and charts, feature or object databases, queries and analysis results, terrain models, and 3D / dynamic visualisations. They are supported by documents such as gazetteers, coordinate lists, and geographic studies.  Geospatial information is the foundation for  any operational picture, as exemplified by the traditional situation map. The ability to combine geospatial with additional information digitally is fundamental to modern systems, so that spatial situations can be visualised, analysed, and communicated in relation to the battlespace. NATO Core GIS is key to achieving this within the NATO Command Structure (NCS), providing digital geospatial services to C2, all Functional Services (FS), and general users.  Geospatial support describes activities that ensure geospatial information is available and exploited when and where it is needed, including the associated staff effort to identify requirements and coordinate activity.  Arrangements for geospatial support within NATO seek to identify and manage requirements efficiently, and ensure that co-operating forces &#34;fight off the same map&#34; to prevent mistakes and confusion. This goal must be met in network-enabled conditions, providing a reliable spatial foundation for all levels, components and functions. Geospatial support delivers this foundation through NATO geospatial staff.  Information, intelligence and data sharing with relevant I0, NGO, NNN and partner nations will be in accordance with the Agreed Guidance, on a case-by-case basis, subject to the approval of Allies."

For the purposes of this Policy, a NATO record is defined as information created, received, and/or maintained as evidence and information by NATO, in pursuance of legal obligations, NATO missions or in the transaction of business. In short, NATO records officially document the actions and decisions of the Organization.  A NATO record is therefore NATO information and as such is managed in accordance with the NATO Information Management Policy (NIMP) and related policies. However, the unique nature of records as documentation of NATO decisions and actions necessitates adoption of an additional records-specific policy to complement the NIMP and related policies.

This Directive supports the NATO Information Management Policy (NIMP) and the Primary Directive on Information Management (PDIM), which describe all aspects of information management at a high level.  Records are critical to a reliable assessment of operations both during their conduct and after their completion. Neglecting to capture, manage and preserve operational records has severe consequences for the planning and conduct of the operation. Operational records will support accountability, will help to protect the interests of the Organization, and the rights of those impacted by operations. They also assist in responding to inquiries and media requests. It is therefore NATO policy to manage and preserve operational records.  Records created and/or received by NATO in the context of a NATO operation are NATO records and therefore shall be managed in accordance with the NATO Records Policy (NRP). However, the complexity of military and political interrelationships at the international level and the wide spectrum of crisis situations in which these operational records are generated require specific procedures for their management. Furthermore the multinational character of NATO operations may create specific types of records which are unique to such operations.  Within this Directive, an operational record is defined as â&#128;&#156;information created or received in the course of a NATO operation and maintained as evidence and information by NATO in pursuance of legal obligations, and the conduct of military or civil emergency operationsâ&#128;&#157;.  Records management pertains to the efficient and systematic control of the creation, receipt, maintenance, use and disposition of records. The management of records occurs during every phase of a NATO operation: planning, conduct and post-operation assessment."

                  description="The Counter Insurgency (COIN) mission type consists of political, economic, social, military, law enforcement, civil, and psychological activities that aim to defeat insurgency and address any core grievances. COIN is a politically motivated, intelligence-driven activity and the aim of COIN is to defeat the insurgents. All insurgencies are unique in their political, social, and historical contexts and they demand that the counterinsurgent adapt with skill and knowledge to meet specific socio-political and military conditions. COIN operations often include security assistance programs such as military education and training programs because properly trained and motivated local security and military forces provide the best COIN operators.   Conducting successful COIN operations requires an adaptive and flexible mindset and an understanding that the population is the critical dimension; and a key part of understanding the population is having cultural competence and an intimate knowledge of what causes and perpetuates insurgency. It is equally important as understanding physical terrain is to the successful conduct of conventional land operations. A second aspect of the counterinsurgent mindset is being able to think like an insurgent in order to stay ahead of or at least anticipate the actual insurgentsâ&#128;&#153; decisions and actions. Third, successful counterinsurgents must understand it is essential to establish an enduring presence within the population to create confidence and provide continuous security and development efforts, which are vital to assuring the populationâ&#128;&#153;s sense of security and long-term outlook. This will isolate the insurgents from the population, thus depriving them of recruits, resources, intelligence, and credibility. Finally, it must be clearly understood that the military instrument is only one part of a comprehensive approach for successful COIN, although the security situation may require the joint force to execute tasks that other organizations are better suited to conduct."

They are designed to maintain or re-establish peace or enforce the terms specified in the mandate. In the conduct of PE, the link between political and military objectives must be extremely close. It is important to emphasize that the aim of the PE operation will not be the defeat or destruction of an adversary, but rather to compel, coerce, and persuade the parties to comply with a particular desired outcome and the established rules and regulations.  Peace Enforcement normally takes place under the principles of Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The difference between PE and other Peace Support Operations (PSOs) is that the Chapter VII mandate allows more freedom of action for the commander concerning the use of force without losing legitimacy, with a wider set of options being open. Even in a PE, consent should be pursued through persuasion prior to using force, with coercion through force being an option at any time without altering the original mandate."

Military forces should be ready to assist in relief operations when the need for them arises, and to cooperate with other organizations concerned. Normally, military forces work to create the conditions in which these other agencies can operate more freely and effectively. NATO forces, such as the standing naval forces, may be in the area as a result of an unrelated exercise or operation and could be diverted by direction of the NAC or MC; however, because of the need for speed, it is likely that immediate reaction will be provided unilaterally by nations. Disaster relief could bconducted as a standalone operation; however, because of the requisite response times, it is more likely to take place within the context of an ongoing Non-Article 5 Crisis Response Operation (NA5CRO)."

Under these circumstances, planning must anticipate a potential need for a NATO extraction force. In the past, NATO has established extraction forces, on a temporary basis, to enhance the safety of international missions."

                  description="The Military Aid/Support to Civil Authorities (SCA) mission type consists of military activities that provide temporary support, within means and capabilities, to civil communities or authorities, when permitted by law, and which are normally undertaken when unusual circumstances or an emergency overtaxes the capabilities of the civil authorities. Categories of support include military assistance to covil authorities and support to numanitarian assistance operations.  Military Assistance to Civil Authorities includes military support to civil authorities, civil law enforcement, economic recovery, and military assistance for civil disturbance. Implementation of a civil plan in response to a crisis may depend on the military to provide a stable and secure environment for its implementation. Support might include providing security assistance to an election process and supervising the transition to a democratically elected public administration, training local police and security forces, mine and unexploded ordnance clearing and training of the local population, assisting in public administration, maintaining public services, supporting public administration in coordinating a humanitarian operation, or providing security for individuals, populations, or installations. In exceptional circumstances, within a mandate for a larger mission, NATO military forces could be called on to contribute to tasks related to public security which are the responsibility of a mandated civil authority, organization, or agency. Specifically, military support to public securitywill depend entirely on the mission and the residual local policing and judicial capability, and may require involvement in civil security tasks, including operations to maintain local law and order during the initial stage of an operation, until appropriate civilian authorities can take over thier tasks. This assistance will normally be provided by multinational specialized units (MSUs) or, in special circumstances, other forces."

Sanctions generally concern the denial of supplies, diplomatic, economic, and other trading privileges, and the freedom of movement of those living in the sanctions area. Sanctions may be imposed against a specific party or in the context of Non-Article 5 Crisis Response Operation (NA5CRO), over a wide area embracing all parties. The military objective is to establish a barrier, allowing only non-sanctioned goods to enter or exit. Depending on geography, sanction enforcement normally involves some combination of air, land, and maritime forces. Examples are embargoes, maritime interdiction operations (MIOs), and the enforcement of no-fly zones (NFZs)."

Policies can combine information about the resource, the user and the context to make an access decision using several different ways (different access control modes). The most common access control modes include: Access Control List (ACLs), Role-based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC), etc.  The decision which model (what type of policies) to use depends on required granularity of access control, required ease of administration, overall organization policies, etc.  In many cases hybrid approach may be utilized: RBAC often provides a sufficient level of granularity to define access policies for internal resources; however, an application that has an extensive remote user population may require additional access mechanisms capable of handling ABAC contextual information."

The strategic-level CONOPS, as approved by the NAC should demonstrate how to achieve the strategic objectives and conditions required to attain the desired end state. An illustrative CJSOR and (if possible) an illustrative theatre capability statement of requirements (TCSOR) will be submitted with the CONOPS for information. # Plan and TCSOR development including force generation.

NATO requires a feedback process in order to determine the effectiveness of operations and make recommendations for changes.  A NAC execution directive authorises the execution of an OPLAN (the execution of a SDP is delegated to an appropriate NATO military commander).

                     description="The NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) is a continuous process which NATO utilizes to influence member nations to allocate, when required, forces with the required capabilities to the Alliance capable of successfully accomplishing its missions. In addition to the member nations arsenals, there are some areas where NATO as an owner develops its own capabilities, such as the NATO Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control AEW&amp;C Force.  The main actors in Defence Planning (DP) in NATO are the [[International Staff]] (IS), [[Allied Command Transformation]] (ACT) and the NATO member nations. Important advice is being given by the International Military Staff (IMS) and [[Allied Command Operations]] (ACO).  Defense Planning is done at Alliance level for the following reasons. * The Allies have a large pool of forces which is collectively bigger and better than current possible adversaries. Nevertheless a considerable number of these capabilities are legacy and not designed for modern, rapid, multinational and expeditionary operations. * Many nations have national priorities which often conflict with those of the Alliance. Where it comes to Defence Cost, NATO seeks to create a balanced burden sharing among its member states. This is worked out on the principle of fair burden sharing. To accomplish this, NATO clearly needs to have some sort of process for Defence Planning. * Given reduced overall force levels and constrained resources, the ability to harmonize national and NATO defence planning, including exchanges of information among the Allies about their force plans, will remain vital for ensuring the preparedness of the forces and supporting structures to carry out the full spectrum of Alliance missions.  The aim of collective DP is to ''provide a framework'', within which national and NATO Defence Planning can be ''harmonized to meet the Alliances agreed military requirements'', (which includes support for EU-led operations), in the most effective way. Collective defence planning in the Alliance supports the arrangements that enable member countries to enjoy the crucial political, military and resource advantages of collective defence through the exchange of information, to mutual and collaborative requirements programmes ''needed for modern, rapid, multinational and expeditionary operations''. NATO DP seeks to prevent the re-nationalization of defence policies and to identify and encourage effective use of resources, while at the same time retaining national sovereignty, all within the framework of the NATO Treaty.  Planning horizons for requirements derivation include short(0-6 years), medium (6-15 years) and long-term (15 years and beyond)."

During these phases the planning staff of the Strategic Commander will conduct a CIS Assessment and capture the results in the CIS Initial Estimate. The decision on the required nature of the Mission Execution Environment will be informed at this stage by the scale and nature of the operation. Typically two options will be considered; namely an Integrated Enterprise approach (for small scale missions with limited participation centred on a single major provider), and the Federated approach. The use of the FMN Framework will only apply in the latter case. If the Federated approach is selected then the J6 planning staff of the Strategic Commander will call a Strategic Mission Network Planning Conference to define the strategic architecture for the Mission Network and to provide CIS inputs to the provisional statement of requirements (SOR).   To assist with the collective design of the Mission Execution Environment, the potential Mission Participants, together with the FMN affiliates, may choose to form a Mission Network Secretariat for the Lead Operational Commander instead of relying on the  existing FMN Governance and Management Organizations. If required, the potential Mission Network Participants may also decide to form its own decision-making structures at this stage, perhaps headed by a Mission Network Executive Group. Depending on complexity, a dedicated Mission Network Architecture WG may be needed to produce and maintain the Target Architecture for the Mission Network based on the FMN Reference Architecture .  The CIS Estimate will be taken into the CONOPS development phase of the Operational planning process, which will involve the planning staff of the Strategic Commander and the Lead operational Commander who will develop his C2 requirements based on the C2 Concept produced by the strategic commander. During this phase a detailed mission analysis will be made to determine which of the FMN Enable Mission threads should be selected for the mission and whether there are any Mission Threads that are unsupported by the FMN framework. Where there are omissions, these will be provided back to the FMN Framework Management organisations (i.e. the Operational Coordination Working Group) to be addressed rapidly. Planners can accelerate this phase by using information from the FMN Governance processes regarding the current capabilities of the FMN Affiliates contributing troops to the mission (i.e. the degree to which each FMN-enabled Mission thread can be federated) and by utilising information provided by the FMN Service Catalogue to identify pre-validated FMN capabilities of the prospective Mission Network participants.  Using any the mission analysis and the list of required mission threads that need to be supported across the federated network, a Provisional Mission Service Catalogue will be developed in coordination with all potential Mission Network contributing participants. This will be used to inform the further development of the provisional SOR.   During CONOPs development the Supreme Commander will also establish a provisional Service Management Authority for the planned Mission Network."

This will identify, activate and sustain the forces and capabilities required and specify the sequence of the strategic activities and operations, including the deployment, employment, sustainment and C2 of forces for the accomplishment of the mission, as well as the possible necessary interaction required with cooperating entities.  Planning will involve the issue of the SOR to potential mission participants at the beginning of this phase together with the Activation Warning.  Using the Strategic CONOPs to determine the determine the primary security classification and release criteria for the federated Mission Network, a call for participation in the Mission Network Security Accreditation Board will be made with ACTWARN to all mission participants that intend to act as Service Providers on the Mission Network.  The Lead Operational Commander will also assign the following roles that require delegated authority from the Supreme Commander and Mission Participants: * Mission Network Service Management Authority â&#128;&#147; responsible for Mission Network architecture, Mission Network service strategy, Mission Network Service Catalogue, Service Management (SM) Plan, MN Joining, Membership and Exit Instructions (JMEI), naming, numbering and addressing for the Mission Network, provision of the Mission Network Change Advisory Board and Mission Network Operations Centre. * Appoint the Mission Network Information Management Authority - including IM Plan development and Mission Thread Analysis. * Establish the Mission Network Security Accreditation Board to execute the responsibilities of the Mission Network Security Accreditation Board such as providing Approval to Operate (ATO) to Mission Participants and establishment of the Mission CIS Security Framework (see also the templates for Community Security Requirements Statement , MN Security Accreditation Board TORs, PKI Manager within MN Service Management Authority etc.).  The Mission Network Service Management Authority will assist the Lead Operational Commander in identifying the Mission Network Working Groups necessary for the Mission Network and tailoring the ToRs from the extant FMN Spiral Specification document templates.  Using the extant FMN Spiral Specification Reference Architecture, the Mission Network Service Management Authority will: * produce the instantiated architecture for the Mission * prepare and issue Joining, Membership and Exit Instructions (JMEI) for the Mission Network based on the respective FMN Specifications (Service and Procedural Instructions, as well as Document Templates).  In this phase the Mission Network participants will provide an update on status of forces and capabilities that will be made available to the mission network. These should all be from certified â&#128;&#152;FMN-Readyâ&#128;&#153; Forces. To enable the automated processing of this information, participants should submit this information in the form of a formal 'Network Capability Message' to the Supreme Commander. Planners at that level will validate and update the common force database with the mission network capabilities. These mission network capabilities will identify the 'solution building blocks' available to design and build the actual Mission Service Catalogue for the mission.  Once the Mission Service Catalogue is established, the preparation of the required instances of the Mission Verification and Validation Environment and Mission training Environments can take place. It should be noted that the degree to which these will be required will depend on the primary security classification and release criteria for the federated Mission Network. If the sensitivity of the operation is low, use could also be made of Mission Enclaves on the FMN Verification and Validation Environment and the Collective Training Environment.   To refine the Mission Network architecture and develop CIS aspects of the operation plan (OPLAN) and CIS inputs to the statement of requirements (SOR) J6 staff planners of the Lead Operational Commander and the Mission Network Service Management Authority may conduct an 'Operational MN Planning Conference'. This will require mission participants intending to act as Service Providers on the Mission Network to complete and return their Service Configuration Templates.  Once the OPLAN has been developed, the Supreme Commander will present the SOR to the mission participants. This will represent his estimate of the minimum military requirement for forces and capabilities to conduct the operation within acceptable risks.  The Lead Operational Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s CIS Annex to the OPLAN will document the overarching CIS architecture for the mission and the expected CIS contributions from mission participants. This CIS architecture will provide the basis for the development of a detailed Mission Service Strategy and Mission Service Catalogue by the Service Management Authority. It will also define a Service Management and Control (SMC) Plan produced by the J6 staff planners and the Mission Network Service Management Authority in coordination with potential â&#128;&#152;Service Providersâ&#128;&#153;. A Mission CIS Security Framework will also be produced using the templated Community Security Requirements Statement template as a basis.  The Lead Operational Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s IKM Annex to the OPLAN will document an Information Management (IM) Plan for the mission. This will have been produced by the IM staff (Information Managers, archivists and historians) and the Mission Network Information Management Authority.  Through the deployable forces identification processes and the operations planning force generation procedures the Supreme Commander will formally request potential Mission participants to provide information on forces, force capabilities and CIS capabilities. Where the Mission participants are FMN Affiliates, these will be certified â&#128;&#152;FMN-readyâ&#128;&#153; forces. Critical shortfalls in CIS capabilities required for mission success will be identified and filled through force balancing or reported to the Supreme Commander.  Following the Force Generation conference, J6 staff of the Lead Operational Commander and the Mission Network Service Management Authority conduct the â&#128;&#152;Mission Network Preparation workshopâ&#128;&#153; to refine the Mission Network architecture, service strategy and service catalogue based on the results of the Force Generation Process and develop deployment and configuration details."

                           description="Upon receipt of the Activation Order or Execution Directive, the Mission Execution Environment will be formally instantiated with the full suite of services as defined in the Mission Service Catalogue.  During the instantiation phase, operational C2 activities will be supported by existing stand-by CIS capabilities for a limited period. This initial set of services would be delivered using information products required by the most common mission threads. Services would include the core or root levels of many of the services, such as email and voice, and many of the top-level COI functional systems. The Mission Network participant capable to provide this initial in theatre suite of services would typically be that sourcing the deployed operational commander, and would provide the first network element of the Mission Network to which other Mission network participants could connect. Typically this first Mission Network Participant will be the Mission Network Service Management Authority.  At an early stage and to control the instantiation phase, the Mission Network Service Management Authority will establish a presence in theatre [usually as part of the [Mission] Signal Support Group (SSSG) of the  lead Operational Commander.]. Additionally the Change Advisory Board would be set up in line with federated change management procedures as agreed in the Service Management Plan. To manage the operations for the federated network, a MN Network Operations Centre would be established (again as part of the [Mission] SSSG organisation) with LNO and federated Service Management toolsets and the processes of the Mission Network Participants as agreed in the Service Management Plan.   Prior to connection, the Mission Network Service Management Authority will hold short pre-connection workshop/confirmatory tests in theatre with certified â&#128;&#152;FMN-Readyâ&#128;&#153; forces (who will federate their networks) to ensure settings from Service Instruction Templates (JMEI) have been followed. The Mission Network Service Management Authority will then connect each Service Provider's segment as it is formed to establish the Mission Network. The network management authority of each service providing network segment will then connect the Service Consumer's network segments with whom prior arrangements have been made to their own networks and accommodate Hosted Users within its network segment as they arrive.  The Mission Network Service Management Authority will formally instantiate Mission Execution Environment with full suite of services (as defined in the Mission Service Catalogue).   During the expansion and subsequent stages, the mission may extend beyond the point where existing assets can adequately sustain the growing demand. Here the topology may well have to change (e.g. by closing links between meshed network  elements) to optimize the federation of Mission Networks. The function of Mission Network Service Management Authority may also need to transition from a national to a multinational responsibility, or between Nations as National commitments and the roles played by National Force on an operation change over time. Likewise such changes may also require the transfer of responsibility for core or root levels of services.  As the operation progresses, the users will execute the mission threads relevant to the operation. In doing so they will produce Requests for Change (RFC). These RFCs will be handled by the change management processes of the Mission Network Service Management Authority and handled through the Mission Network Change Advisory Board. Where these are to an existing federated service or involve the introduction of a new service, such changes are likely to be processed by the management organisations of the Federated mission network out of theatre. Some changes that are not part of the current FMN Spiral Specifications and are specific to the mission requirements may also need to be made. All changes involving changes to federated services will be technically verified and operationally validated supported by the Mission Verification and Validation Environment Instance.  Once brought into the specification for the Mission Network Fielded Baseline (a mission specific deviation from the Specification for the FMN Fielded baseline), the Service providers will equip the deployed forces according to a revised FMN Fielded Baseline. In line with the Mission specific deviations, the Mission Network Service Instructions (JMEI) and CIS/User training packages for the â&#128;&#152;FMN-enabledâ&#128;&#153; Mission Threads will be also adjusted. Where the changes are significant, the Mission Network Service Strategy will need to be assessed.  The revised FMN Fielded Baseline, revised FMN Instructions and revised CIS/User Training packages for the â&#128;&#152;FMN-enabledâ&#128;&#153; Mission Threads will be used to train users in readiness for deployment on the Mission. The training of users on the Mission Specific adaptations to the suite of FMN-enabled Mission Threads will be supported by the Mission Training Environment Instance.  Lessons learned from the application of the FMN Fielded Baseline, FMN Instructions, FMN Service Catalogue and utility of the CIS/User Training packages for the â&#128;&#152;FMN-enabledâ&#128;&#153; Mission Threads will be continually provided to the FMN Framework capability governance processes.  If the operation is perceived as potentially having a long lifespan, the impact of the deviations in the Mission Network Service Strategy versus the FMN Service Strategy will need to be assessed by the Lead Operational Commander, the Mission Network Service Management Authority and the FMN Management Organizations. This may at some point require consideration of a mid-life upgrade to align the Mission Network with the direction taken by the bulk of the FMN community. The decision to do this however will of course be operationally driven."

The SMA will determine if there are any overlaps between MN Participants and recommend changes. * MNE Providers need to have a Unique BGP ASN number, known to the Mission as the ASN for that MNE Provider ** If a MNE Provider has public assigned ASNs, this needs to be communicated to the SMA. ** In case MNE Providers have Private ASNs, the SMA needs to be notified to ensure that there are no conflicts *** If Private ASNs overlap with an already private assigned ASN by the SMA , then they need to change to a new SMA issued Private ASN *** If PrivateASNs do not overlap with any other SMA assigned private ASN, it is marked, recorded  and accepted The process for IPv4 address space is identical to the ASN process as outlined above ** NOTE: MNE Providers might not be able to consolidate their own networks (e.g. Army, Navy, Airforce), this resulted in fragmented networks.

                           description="The Land Appreciation and Assessment of Options Process is the Phase 2 of the Land C2 Processes at the level of the Land Component Command (LCC).  The purpose of the Land Appreciation and Assessment of Options Process is twofold:  # To understand: #* the strategic and operational situation,  #* the nature of the problem,  #* NATOâ&#128;&#153;s desired end state,  #* NATO strategic, military strategic and land objectives.  # To provide land advice to Joint Force Command (JFC) for its own operational advice.  The Land Appreciation and Assessment of Options Process is realized in different sequential steps :  * LAND RESOURCES ORGANIZATION AND GATHERING PROCESS - Once planning is initiated, the LCC HQ develops a timeline and assign personnel to the planning effort. The J35 or planning group leader may choose to create a smaller planning team and assign a leader to the task to balance other competing requirements. Relevant documents, assessments, and products are identified and consolidated for the planning effort.  * LAND PROBLEM STATEMENT DEVELOP PROCESS - The planners develop a problem statement to guide the planning effort. This prevents losing focus of the problem as planning progresses through the phases and steps. The problem statement is reviewed periodically by the group and is modified as the level of understanding improves, due to the analysis of available information.  * LAND CPOE REVIEW PROCESS - The CPOE is updated continuously during a campaign or operation. If the planning group is not fully aware of the situation, they should review relevant resources and products that may assist with the planning effort. This step may be omitted if the planners have a complete understanding of the situation related to the planning effort.  * LAND OPERATIONAL AREA FOR PLANNING, OPERATIONAL, AND SUSTAINMENT IMPACTS ASSESSMENT PROCESS - The operational area is evaluated for impacts given the threat and friendly situation. This step may be omitted if the planners have a complete understanding of the area and operational impacts.  * LAND KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS - Based on the review of the CPOE, assessment of the operational area, and/or current level of understanding, planners identify knowledge gaps and create knowledge requirements (KRs) to fill the gaps. The KRs become RFIs to various elements, internal or external to the LCC, to facilitate planning. One individual should be responsible for managing KRs and associated RFIs for the planning effort. As the planning effort continues through the steps and following phases, KRs and RFIs are continuously updated. Whenever information is received, the group is updated.  * LAND CCIRS AND DEVELOP IRS REVIEW PROCESS - Concurrent with developing KRs and RFIs, the group reviews the current CCIRs and related intelligence to determine if additional intelligence requirements exist for the situation. The IRs are monitored and updated throughout the process  * LAND LEGAL AND POLITICAL ASPECTS REVIEW PROCESS - planners should be familiar with the legal and political aspects of the current campaign or operation which includes international law, treaties, conventions, and guidance set forth in the current OPLAN. The legal and political advisors can assist with this step. This step may be omitted if the planning group has an understanding of the aspects.  * LAND ROE REVIEW PROCESS - The ROE is updated periodically and should be considered simultaneously with the legal and political aspects for rules that may impact the planning process. If the planning group understands the ROE and/or receives advice from the legal advisor during planning, this step may be omitted. Request specific ROE if required.  * LAND CURRENT MEDIA AND PUBLIC OPINIONS REVIEW PROCESS - The current state of public opinion and media attitudes can influence operations conducted by the LCC. It is important for planners to consider the opinions and attitudes which may provide options during the planning process in order to achieve the desired effects, prevent unintended consequences, and support the strategic communications message. If the planning group is thoroughly familiar with the media and public situation, this step may be omitted.  * LAND DESIRED END STATE, OBJECTIVES, AND EFFECTS REFINEMENT PROCESS - The planning group should review and critically analyse the documents and guidance set forth for the planning effort. It may be useful to quickly develop a mini-design sketch of the stated end state, objectives, and desired effects to help guide the planning efforts. This is not a creation of a LCC design for the planning effort or an amendment to the current operational design rather it is a graphical depiction of what is being directed to aid planning by the group.  * LAND FORCE ASSESSMENT PROCESS - It is important for the planning group to have a firm understanding of the pending, on-going, and future operations along with commitments of each of the LCCâ&#128;&#153;s subordinate elements. It is equally important to understand the capabilities and limitations (e.g., national caveats, assets, etc.) of the elements in order to aid future operations and branch planning. This force assessment is aided through a review of situation reports, C2IS tools , and update briefings. Various members of the LCC J3-current operations section may be invaluable in developing the assessment based on their knowledge of the current situation and force capabilities/limitations.  * LAND CURRENT C2 STRUCTURE REVIEW PROCESS - Based on the fluid nature of operations and limited resources available within the LCC, it is useful to review the current C2 structure after the force assessment. This aids those in the planning process to consider all options during future phases and steps which may require a change to the LCCâ&#128;&#153;s task organization and/or the need for attaching or detaching forces to accomplish the mission.  * LAND PRECONDITIONS FOR THE LCCâ&#128;&#153;S SUCCESS DETERMINATION PROCESS - After completing the previous steps of this phase, the planning group should identify any preconditions required for the LCCâ&#128;&#153;s success of the assigned task or mission. These preconditions should help generate additional RFIs, intelligence requirements, changes, and supporting operations vital to achieve the overall objective.  * LAND ASSESSMENT BRIEFING PROCESS - The assessment briefing serves to provide a common level of awareness to the commander and/or J3 related to the situation. Assessment Briefing: At a minimum, the assessment briefing should include the problem and desired end state/objective, JTF COMâ&#128;&#153;s mission, JTF COMâ&#128;&#153;s intent, Current SOCC missions and tasks, SOF units and capabilities available for planning, Current C2 structure, Preconditions for success  * LAND LCC WNGO PROCESS - If enough details are available, the LCC should issue a WNGO to potential sections and units. This may be delayed until further information is developed during the planning process but should be issued as soon as possible."

                           description="The Land Orientation Process is Phase 3 of the Land C2 Processes at the level of the Land Component Command (LCC).   The purpose of the Land Operational Orientation Process is to determine the land problem that must be solved, the specific land conditions that must be created, the key land factors that will influence the achievement of those conditions, and any limitations on the Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s freedom of action for the development of the overall land design.  The Land Orientation Process is realized in different sequential steps :  * LAND FACTS DETERMINATION PROCESS - At his stage the pertinent documents and guidance related to the planning effort should be reviewed; what is known about the situation that is relevant and has a bearing on the problem should be determine . Listing the known facts after completing the previous combined phase helps to identify additional knowledge gaps and expand the list of RFIs to enhance planning.  * LAND ASSIGNED MISSION AND OBJECTIVES ANALYSIS PROCESS - Critically analyse the mission, tasks, and objectives assigned to the LCC. These should be separated from the facts listed in the previous process.  * LAND SPECIFIED, IMPLIED, AND MISSION ESSENTIAL ACTIONS DETERMINATION PROCESS - Create a list of specified actions (tasks) that are assigned to the LCC. From this list, develop actions or tasks that are implied and relevant to the accomplishment of the assigned mission which are not inherent or considered part of standard operating procedures. From the combined list, determine the actions considered critical to mission success. There are generally three to five actions that, if not completed, result in mission failure. As a result, the commander designates these as mission essential actions.  * LAND IMPACT OF TIME, SPACE, FORCE, AND INFORMATION ASSESSMENT PROCESS - To aid with the development of assumptions and determining operational requirements and risk, planners must consider the actions of the land forces and enabling/supporting forces in relation to time, space, and information.  * LAND ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS - The outcome of the Assess the Impact of Time, Space, Force, and Information process coupled with current knowledge gaps necessitates the development of valid assumptions to continue planning. JTF HQâ&#128;&#153;s assumptions are considered facts and not assumptions for the LCC. If an assumption proves opposite than what is supposed, but it does not cause mission failure or a major revision to the plan or to a branch plan, it is not an assumption but rather a planning factor that may be useful elsewhere in planning. Every effort must be made to change assumptions into facts through research, coordination, and the RFI process. Finally, do not assume operational success or failure of the adversary; these are not valid assumptions for planning.  * LAND CRITICAL OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS DETERMINATION PROCESS - Analyse the list of actions or tasks (specified, implied, and essential) to determine what operational support and resource requirements are critical to mission accomplishment. Review the basic strategic communication messages and determine what, if any, requirements exist for the operation. Consider the preconditions that are beyond the LCCs influence that are required for mission accomplishment and/or success; update as required. Review the current KRs, finalize the list of IRs for the mission, and coordinate with the J2 for collection planning.  * LAND REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERACTION WITH RELEVANT ACTORS DETERMINATION PROCESS - Analyzing the area the mission is to take place identifies complementary activities (military and non-military) that must be considered, coordinated, and/or synchronized to achieve the desired effects. The requirements from this process result in tasks to various elements of the LCC or to subordinate units.  * LAND LIMITATIONS IDENTIFICATION PROCESS - Limitations are divided into two categories, constraints (what must be done) and restraints (what may not be done) that limit freedom of action in accomplishing the mission. These limitations must be considered during risk assessment development process.  * LAND RISK ASSESSMENT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS - The planning groupâ&#128;&#153;s initial risk assessment primarily addresses the risk to mission and the operational risk to the force; tactical risks to the force and mitigation measures are the responsibility of the commander executing the mission. A simple matrix outlines the identified risks, impact to the operation, mitigation measures that reduce or limit the probability and severity, and residual risk analysis.  * LAND OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVES ANALYSIS PROCESS - Consider the commanderâ&#128;&#153;s desired effects in relation to the operation being planned. This allows the operation to be placed into greater context within the overall campaign.  * LAND TENTATIVE MISSIONS FOR SUBORDINATE COMMANDERS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS - Based on the completed steps of mission analysis, the planning group develops tentative missions and objectives for subordinate units. It is important to consider all the actions and tasks identified and to remember that the exact element(s) may not be identified at this point, so the mission statement may remain generic; missions will be refined, assigned, and collaborated with the appropriate subordinate elements during CONOPS development. Mission statements must cover the who, what, when, where, and why of the operation but leave the how to the commander executing the operation.  * LAND COMMANDERS INTENT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS - The planning group leader may choose to draft the initial intent based on experience and/or personal knowledge of the commander. The commanderâ&#128;&#153;s intent reflects the commanderâ&#128;&#153;s enduring vision of the operation while enabling subordinate elementsâ&#128;&#153; mission command and initiative. The intent should include: (a) The purpose of the operation. (b) The general phasing (sequencing) of the operation. (c) The identification of the main effort. (d) The level of acceptable risk and unacceptable risk.

Planners should identify significant shortfalls which may constitute a risk to the assigned mission and may require the commanderâ&#128;&#153;s attention. Planners must anticipate supporting and enabling requirements for the operation and may begin early coordination or submit the appropriate requests in an effort to secure the required support.  * LAND C2 REQUIREMENTS ESTIMATION PROCESS - Once the force estimate is complete, the preliminary C2 structure from the previous phase to assess is considered if any potential exists that requires a task organization change or the need to attach forces to or detach forces from the LCC.  * LAND MISSION ANALYSIS BRIEF PROCESS - At the end of the brief, confirm the proposed initial intent to the commander and receive the commanderâ&#128;&#153;s guidance for COA development."

                           description="The Land Concept of Operations (CONOPS) Development Process is Phase 4a of the Land C2 Processes at the level of the Land Component Command (LCC).   The purpose of the Land CONOPS Development Process is to determine how best to carry out operations that will accomplish the mission effectively and efficiently in accordance with the Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s Intent. This is a collaborative planning effort to produce a land CONOPS in coherency with the strategical and operational CONOPS.   The Land Concept of Operations (CONOPS) Development Process is realized in different sequential steps :  * LAND GUIDANCE GATHERING AND REVIEWING PROCESS - It is important to capture the commanderâ&#128;&#153;s guidance and to review it immediately upon receipt. It is helpful to determine how the group will handle COA development â&#128;&#147; unified or split into sub-groups. It is also important for the leader to determine if he will participate in COA development or remain neutral in order to monitor and guide the COA development to ensure the concepts meet the commanderâ&#128;&#153;s guidance and are completed in a timely manner. A standard template for depicting each COA should be utilized to ease comparison and the decision brief.  * LAND ENEMY COAS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS - It is important that the enemy COAs are considered during planning and are included in the order. The groupâ&#128;&#153;s intelligence planner, working closely with the J2 directorate, determines the enemyâ&#128;&#153;s most likely and most dangerous COAs.  * LAND COAS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS - The COAs may compare forces regarding a change to the mission or to execute a target leaving the actual tactical planning and wargaming to the executing unit.  * LAND COAS ANALYSIS PROCESS - The planning group is responsible for analysing and testing COAs for viability (suitability, acceptability, feasibility, exclusivity, completeness, and compliance with NATO doctrine.  * LAND COAS COMPARISON PROCESS - The commanderâ&#128;&#153;s COA development guidance should be fully understood before choosing the method of comparison. In hasty planning, time generally permits utilizing only one of the three methods available for comparison. (a) Compare COAs against Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s Selection Criteria. This is the preferred method when the commander is provided with selection criteria for COA selection. (b) Compare COAs Advantages and Disadvantages. This method is the preferred method used in the absence of defined selection criteria. It is possible for the planning group to present criteria for the commander to consider based on the experience level of the planning group. (c) Compare Friendly and Opposing COAs.  * LAND DECISION BRIEF PROCESS - The planning staff briefs the commander on friendly and enemy COAs. One is recommended. The commander will decide which COA, or combinations of COAs, fits his overall intent best. At the end of the COA decision brief, provide the commander an update on the timeline and way ahead and request additional guidance, if required. Be prepared for the commander to modify the COA selected and/or to provide the planning group guidance that must be quickly addressed to finalize the plan and to issue orders.  * LAND CONOPS PRODUCTION PROCESS - To aid the planning efforts of the executing unit, once identified, the planning group should use the vast array of capabilities to shell a CONOPS to accompany the order. The planning group must not attempt to complete the tactical plan or related portion of the CONOPS; leave the tactical details and mission command to the executing unit. If the CONOPS requires approval by the senior level, a courtesy copy may be provided to the appropriate LO, as appropriate, indicating a full CONOPS will follow once developed by the executing unit and approved by the commander."

                        description="The Land Operations Execution Processes aim to put a plan into action by applying combat power to accomplish the mission and using situational awareness to assess progress and make execution and adjustment decisions. Inherent in the Land Operations Execution Process is deciding to execute planned actions, such as phases, branches and sequels, as well as deciding to change the plan based on changes in the situation. During the Land Operations Execution Process the commander directs the application of combat power, ensuring adequate, but not excessive, synchronization. He must maintain continuity of operations so as to prevent the enemy from regaining his equilibrium.  The Land Operations Execution Process entails much more than just putting the plan into action. Executing is a continuous process of three activities: # Assessing the current state and forecasting progress of the operation; # Making execution and adjustment decisions to account for unforeseen enemy actions and exploit opportunities; # Directing actions to apply combat power to accomplish the mission.  During execution changes occur, some from effective or ineffective action by the enemy or friendly forces, and some from changes within the environment. Successful execution depends on identifying and adapting to one or a combination of changes in these elements.  The Land Operations Execution Processes incorporate two methods for adapting to changes. The first method (included within Land Operations Planning Processes), consists of anticipating changes and developing branches and sequels to the plan to deal with them. Anticipating changes does not end with planning; it continues throughout preparation and execution, especially during execution. Study and development help the commander apply analysis and judgment to understand a situation, establish valid, realistic criteria for decisions, and comprehend the relationships in command to anticipate events and consequences.  The second method of adapting to change is improvising, taking action or adopting solutions to unforecasted changes during the operation. While improvisation is not preferred, situations frequently arise requiring its use. The real difference between the methods is time: anticipation occurs when the enemyâ&#128;&#153;s actions are foreseen early enough to develop an analytical response. Improvising occurs when the enemy action is unexpected and does not allow time for formal planning of a response."

These processes are complementary to other component targeting processes and is conducted in all operations throughout the operational framework in both current and planned future operations. Targeting has utility throughout the operational spectrum, from high to low intensity operations and throughout the range of lethal and non-lethal systems. In addition, formation/manoeuvre commanders in rear areas may benefit from the application of targeting principles. The introduction into service in recent years of sophisticated systems able to accurately detect and track targets together with new effects systems has heightened the profile of targeting.   In achieving the formation/manoeuvre commanderâ&#128;&#153;s intent, targeting is concerned with producing specific effects in a systematic manner. Targeting methodology considers all targeting options, both lethal and non-lethal, to achieve desired effects with the least risk, time and expenditure of resources.  The Land Targeting Processes are based on a cycle of sub-processes: Decide; Detect; Track; Deliver; and Assess. This methodology provides a systematic approach to enable the right target to be effected with the appropriate system at the right time and place. The process provides an effective method for matching friendly capabilities against the most important targets in order to achieve the formation/manoeuvre commanders desired effects. It is a dynamic process that allows those involved in the targeting process to keep up with rapidly changing situations. The methodology, tools and products described in this chapter must be continually reviewed as the situation develops and updated on the basis of situation reports and combat assessments. The functions are not necessarily phased or sequenced and may frequently occur throughout operational planning and execution."

The effectiveness of staff effort in the Decide Process will probably determine how effective the operational targeting effort will be. Targeting takes place at the same time and in parallel with, operations staff estimates and the intelligence collection effort. It may assist in setting priorities for intelligence collection and effects planning.  The different steps of this process are : * Identify Target Types - Target types and categories will depend on the nature of the operation and the range of effects available. Targets will be developed into target lists and further refined through intelligence collection and the need to manage the dynamic nature of the formation/manoeuvre commanders' operational requirements.  * Identify Target Areas - This Process will consider the Area of Operations and identify areas of targeting interest. All dimensions of the battlespace environment should be considered and limitations such as protected areas taken into account.  * Establish Target Accuracy Process - The capabilities of available detection systems and effects systems will dictate technical and procedural limits that should be established. It is important to match appropriate ISTAR and effects systems in order to engage targets.  * Input to Intelligence Collection Plan - Targeting input to the intelligence collection mechanism aims to provide a focus for the management of detection systems. Input will identify priority targets, how they might be detected and whether target tracking is required.  * Establish Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) Criteria - Decisions must be made early in the process as to what can be defined as a successful (or unsuccessful) attack. There should also be decisions concerning the direction of systems to obtain BDA. Only effective BDA can assess that the effects desired by the formation/manouevre commander are being produced.  * Develop Attack Guidance Matrix (AGM) - The AGM provides a consolidated, tabulated support tool for operational targeting decisions and is the culmination of the Decide phase of the cycle. The matrix is intended to act, as far as practical, as an executive document allowing rapid engagement decisions to be made during current operations. AGM should be developed for each phase of an operation and for different operations."

From a LCC perspective, the NATO C4ISR function must also be compatible with and be able to support and operate in tandem with the inter-agency ISR infrastructure to afford seamless and timely sharing of information. This, in turn, enables the LCC to better support the effects-based targeting process across the whole spectrum of comprehensive operations.  It is common for subordinate units to not have assigned ISR assets; they will most likely have to bid to the LCC for ISR support by submitting a SPTREQ for non-airborne ISR capabilities or an AIRSUPREQ for airborne ISR capabilities. The SPTREQ/AIRSUPREQ should be submitted with the draft CONOPS to the J35 and copied to the J2-CCIRM.  While the J35 is staffing the CONOPS, the J2-CCIRM will be ascertaining if the request is valid, if it is in accordance with the JTF and LCCâ&#128;&#153;s intent and guidance, and whether the request can be supported from within the LCCâ&#128;&#153;s order of battle (ORBAT) of assigned ISR assets that are supporting the collection plan.  A. If the SPTREQ/AIRSUPREQ is supported by the J2-CCIRM and if spare capacity exists within the LCC ORBAT, ISR assets may be detached to the SOTGs/SOATGs under delegated C2 relationships for short durations to support specific missions.  B. If there is insufficient capacity or inappropriate capabilities within the LCC ORBAT to fulfil the SPTREQ/ AIRSUPREQ, the J2-CCIRM can request the required ISR support by submitting the SPTREQ/ AIRSUPREQ to the JTF or other components (dependent on which HQ is designated as the DARB coordinating authority) for DARB consideration.  The DARB is the coordinating authority for all theatre ISR assets but does not have authority over ISR assets that are considered organic to a component commander. J2-CCIRM staff members who submit SPTREQs/AIRSUPREQs for additional ISR support should evaluate the likelihood of their requests being approved within the context of the JFCâ&#128;&#153;s direction and guidance outlined in the JCO, the published JPTL, and the JFCâ&#128;&#153;s ISR priorities. Alternative plans should be considered to compensate for low priority requests that may be denied based on available ISR capacity.  SPTREQs/AIRSUPREQs for ISR support must be based on the information requirements (desired ISR product, type of sensor required, duration of mission) and not on the specific platform that is perceived to be the best fit to collect the information. The CCIRM process will have more flexibility, and therefore a higher likelihood of meeting the request, if effect and capability are requested rather than specific units, assets, or air platforms.  Once the CONOPS has been authorized, it is handed over to the J33 to monitor and assess during execution. This process is mirrored with the ISR support. Once a SPTREQ/AIRSUPREQ has been approved by the DARB, it will be handed over to the J3-ISR to monitor the execution of this part of the collection plan with the J2-CCIRM, taking a more holistic view of the entire collection plan. Should an ISR contingency occur, the J3-ISR, in liaison with the J2-CCIRM, will monitor and assist as required to ensure the collection plan is maintained.  Once assigned an ISR mission, LCC staff members and subordinate unit commanders should exchange as much information as practically possible with the supporting ISR unit (while still retaining OPSEC). Understanding the task empowers the ISR mission commander with the ability to manage contingency collection plans should changes occur in the pre-planned collection scenario. Mission CONOPS, TIPs, target grid reference graphics, etc., are all examples of information that will be of assistance to the ISR mission commander when conducting the pre-planned collection plan or when executing a contingent collection plan. If electronic warfare capabilities are planned to support the mission, careful consideration of the effect on friendly forces activity must be undertaken (including interference with electronic forms of finding, fixing, and tracking the enemy). By virtue of their height above the ground and the line of sight that this provides, EW can often cross into adjacent formationsâ&#128;&#153; AOOs causing unplanned and detrimental effects."

LCC normally owns battlespace, so it is imperative that operations are coordinated, deconflicted, and that the appropriate control measures are in place prior to mission execution. LCC should review all CONOPS to ensure the mission is properly synchronized and should monitor the mission to assist with resolving unforeseen issues."

                           description="Joint fires is defined as fires applied during the employment of forces from two or more components, in coordinated action toward a common objective. The LCC has full ability to support joint fires; therefore, subordinate units often coordinate fires directly with the battlespace owner. During subordinate unit planning, additional fires may be requested by submitting the appropriate request to the LCC who validates and actions the request internally, or initiates coordination through the appropriate liaison element. It is important to remember to request a capability or desired effect and not a particular weapons system or platform. Fires can be on call or contingency fires. # A forward air controller (FAC) can request fires based on pre-planned on-call requests for effects. # Multiple avenues are available to service the request: directly to the aircraft if assigned to support; via the Tactical Air Request Net to an airborne or regional C2 node for coordination; or to an AOC at the next level up for coordination. # The FAC, JOC, AOC, combined air operations centre (CAOC), and airborne C2 centre all have defined authorities and assets to address the FACâ&#128;&#153;s request. # The assignment of fires is based on anti-surface force air operation (ASFAO), ISR, and TST prioritization matrices that reflect the JTF HQâ&#128;&#153;s priorities. # Support does not have to be an airborne capability; pre-coordinated naval gunfire support, medium or short range rocket systems, artillery systems, and mortar support can all be employed to meet joint fires support requests."

                     description="Joint Targeting is the process of determining the effects necessary to achieve the commanderâ&#128;&#153;s objectives, identifying the actions necessary to create the desired effects based on means available, selecting and prioritizing targets, and the synchronization of fires with other military capabilities and then assessing their cumulative effectiveness and taking remedial action if necessary. It is both an operational level and component level command function.  The Joint Targeting Cycle (JTC) has a logical progression that aids decision-making and provides the JFC with a methodology linking objectives with effects throughout the battlespace. It is flexible enough to be adapted to any military operation desired and across diverse functional areas, such as air interdiction and information operations. This process enables the JFC to most effectively employ allocated resources to achieve the assigned objectives.  Joint forces require a common joint targeting process in order to minimize the likelihood of conflicting or duplicative actions during military operations, as well as to mitigate potentially undesirable consequences resulting from the outcome of those operations. Consequently, components must understand the joint targeting process if they are to create the effects necessary to accomplish the JFCâ&#128;&#153;s objectives. A common understanding of the joint targeting process and adherence to its principles among joint force staff and subordinate component staffs ability to:  * Ensure JFC compliance with NAC, MC and SC guidance and instructions; * Comply with JFC objectives, guidance, and intent; * Focus on adversaryâ&#128;&#153;s centres of gravity (COG) and related decisive points (DPs); * Coordinate, synchronize, and de-conflict actions; * Rapidly respond to targets that present limited opportunities for action; * As resources permit, assign the most appropriate means to the proposed target; * Minimize duplication of effort; * Expedite assessment of executed operations; * Provide a common perspective on all targeting efforts performed in support of the commander; and * Fully integrate all capabilities.  The joint targeting cycle consists of six phases. The phases are built upon the principles of effective and efficient joint targeting. The cycle focuses targeting options on the JFCâ&#128;&#153;s objectives for operations, while diminishing the likelihood of undesirable consequences:  : Phase 1 â&#128;&#148; Analysis of the JFCâ&#128;&#153;s Objectives, Guidance, and Intent; : Phase 2 â&#128;&#148; Target Development, Validation, Nomination, and Prioritisation; : Phase 3 â&#128;&#148; Capabilities Analysis; : Phase 4 â&#128;&#148; Force Planning and Assignment; : Phase 5 â&#128;&#148; Mission Planning and Force Execution; : Phase 6 â&#128;&#148; Assessment  The Joint Force Commander establishes a Joint Coordination Board at the appropriate JFC HQ for campaign synchronization and joint targeting review and approval. Also, at the appropriate JFC HQ, a Joint Targeting Coordination Board (JTCB) is formed.  For different phases of a campaign, the JCB amplifies the JFCâ&#128;&#153;s Direction and Guidance into a series of Joint Coordination Orders (JCO) that are iteratively refined between JCB and the JTCB.  At the start of the new campaign, NATO requests potential targets in the area of interest from various NATO nations. SHAPE allocates these potential targets into an Integrated Database (IDB). JTCB creates an initial Joint Target List (JTL) from IDB.  JTL is maintained by JTCB through continuing liaison and co-ordination with the JCB and CC HQs. At the same time, JTCB maintains mobile targets in Mobile Target List (MTL) within JTL. The JTL is used for the development of targets including production of target materials in target folders.  For each phase of a campaign, using the JCO for guidance, the JTCB produces the Joint Prioritized Target List (JPTL) where the targets have been coordinated and de-conflicted with all SRCs and relevant organizations of the joint force. The JPTL is submitted to the JCB for review and the JFCâ&#128;&#153;s approval.  JCB maintains a list of targets that are no-strike (prohibited) or restricted, the No-Strike Target List (NSL) and Restricted Targets List (RTL); and assures that those are annotated as restricted or no-strike within JTL. These targets may not be included in a JPTL unless restrictions have been removed as a result of review process.  JPTL is then divided by the JTCB or sub-group of JTCB into a number of Prioritized Target Lists (PTL) that are used by individual subordinate formations for attack.  Force components and SRCs can nominate targets to JTCB for inclusion into the JTL via Target Nomination Lists (TNL). JTCB reviews and combines TNLs.  Planning cells shall plan missions against targets in their assigned PTLs using target details."

Multiple target analysis methods, such as Target System Analysis (TSA) and Critical Node Analysis, are normally employed to identify the adversaryâ&#128;&#153;s strengths, weaknesses, and Centres of Gravity (COG). The analysis performed in target development must be conceived of as proceeding through successively greater levels of detail, flowing from the macro (broad scope) level to the micro (narrowly focused) level.  Critical to the success of the entire targeting process is the establishment of intelligence requirements at all levels, which in turn drives the production of collection plans. The ultimate goal of this expansive research is to support COG analysis and determine exploitable vulnerabilities of the adversary. Targeteers will then select specific targets and target elements that can efficiently be engaged to affect the COG."

The seven steps include:  # Initiation;  # Misison Analysis;  # Determine ADC objectives;  # Develop and priorotise the Joint Priorotised Defended Asset List (JPDAL);  # Develop defence design and force laydown;  # Establish operating procedures;  # Order Development.  The principle outputs of thes processes are the Joint Air Defence Plan (ADP), OPTASK Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) message, OPTASK Link message, applicable Special Instructions (SPINS), Rules of Engagement (ROE) and required briefing materials."

The isolation, capture and/or exploitation of NATO personnel during operations may have a signiï¬&#129;cant negative impact on operational security, morale of assigned forces and public support. In addition, operations may rely on interaction with agencies or other non-NATO actors for which NATO may have a responsibility. NATO has therefore developed a system to recover personnel that have become isolated.  Personnel Recovery is a joint function. SACEUR, the Joint Force Commander (JFC) or Joint Task Force (JTF) Commander may delegate a component commander as the Personnel Recovery Coordinator (PRC), who is the commander responsible for planning and coordination of joint PR operations in support of a NATO operation.  The PRC will normally designate and establish a Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC) to conduct all PR coordination and provide planning in support of all operational environments where PR operations may be required.  Components have responsibility and authority to recover their personnel during an operation.  Component recovery conducted unilaterally is the primary method to recover personnel and return them to friendly control.  Each component will normally establish a Personnel Recovery Coordination Cell (PRCC) to provide the necessary planning and coordination.  When a specific mission exceeds the unilateral capability of a componenet, joint PR missions may be necessary.  It is the responsibility of the JPRC and PRCCs to coordinate PR procedures and requirements for operations.  Most PR activities extend across component and national lines of responsibility.  The availability of recovery assets determines the potential for successfully recovering isolated personnel.  No single force, recovery system or organization is suitable for all situations and may require a mix of conventional, unconventional and non-conventional recovery systems.  Operational flexibility and multi-system redundancy, along with robust command and control are the primary factors in successful recovery operations."

The process formally brings when SACEUR designates an area of interest and  assigns responsibilities for situation monitoring to a JTF HQ. Although the NSHQ commander may not stand up a SOCCPG at this point, the NSHQ and the SOFAD at the designated JTF HQ should begin the knowledge development process.   This process includes developing SOCC RFIs, making initial judgements about the potential threats and risks, and building the SOCCâ&#128;&#153;s knowledge base concerning conditions, trends, population, and previous assessments of the environment. A SOPLE may be deployed to assist and to augment the assigned SOFAD. During this phase, SOCC planners initiate the CPOE and develop their initial assessment."

It brings together providers and requestors by providing a common military market. It functions in the same time as a search machine providing access to the complete available information about logistics Resources and requirements especially, but not limited, with respect to the specific operation. That implies that the process has to provide visibility over the resources and requirements in the AOR, on the way to or from the AOR, but also connecting to databases providing data about the requested capability, that is just somewhere made visible and /or available by any actor and marked basically as sharable.  This process does not replace, but complements the processes for coordinating Supply and Services. The LOG_1 Supply and Services processes rely on the visibility mandated to be provided by TCNs/Actors (i.e assigned as well as critical/reportable resources) and provides very formal processes for their management.   The process Manage Shared Resources should provide the opportunity for every actor1 to offer and search for any Resources they are interested in, on a facultative basis. The principle is  *to enable actors to â&#128;&#156;googleâ&#128;&#157; in all available databases for the Resources they are looking for by inserting any kind of search words or codification information;  *to  provide a facility to report and search for any resources that actors are prepared to share on voluntary basis, including non-critical ones (with respect to the visibility requirements in the O-Plan) - Resources and *provide a capability to match requirements to offers in a coordinated fashion .  Note: Shareable Resources must specify the Compensation method which can be any of those supported by STANAG 2034,  Coordinating Parties in both NATO and National coordinated Supply processes can consider using the common military market as one option for fulfilling the demands.  The role of Coordinating Authority (JLSG, NSPA, etc) is limited to providing visibility and matching options for requests, providing the Requestor with the details required to contact the Provider for performing the transaction; it will not include financial and transportation arrangements for the transaction"

Task and coordinate with CCs and JLSG regarding logistic and M&amp;T support. JTF J4/ LOP will set theatre priorities and authorise appropriate actions to overcome logistic deficiencies &amp; difficulties.  National priority systems will dictate sustainment flow into theatre, except where an item interacts with the NATO operations support chain. In such instances, a NATO standard priority system would translate national movement priorities into a standardized NATO priority for managing items within the support chain. To support this arrangement the JTF HQ support division will maintain a joint mission essential equipment list linked to mission essential operational capability and this will be employed as the mechanism for determining flow into theatre for high priority items. The use of the highest priority code within the arrangement will normally be controlled by a coordination board within the JTF HQ support division and executed by the JLSG HQ.[AJP 4.6B]  The NATO SPS is based on the following three components:  *Unit priority â&#128;&#147; The first component would have 3 tiers and be based on a unitâ&#128;&#153;s capability and derived from theatre mission priorities.  The tiers could be manually assigned OR defaulted as per below and allowing manual override. During the pre-deployment phase this could be SOR based and thereafter during sustainment it would be based on the Capabilities associated to that Unit in association to the Mission Essential Capabilities list. *Urgency of Need.  could be allocated based on Urgency of Need (the relative importance of the request within the unit) â&#128;&#147; a 4 level system is proposed (A-D): Immediate/ Priority/ Routine/ Low *NATO Standard Priority Code (NSPC). When combined, Unit Priority and Urgency of Need generate 12 NATO Standard Priority Codes (NSPC). These can be organised in NATO Priority Categories (NPC) (configurable in number and definition per operation) which could be used as package and transportation priority labels.   For each Priority Category, there should be published operation-specific SCPT; these should be initialised in the OPLAN and revised as required during execution. Allocation to transportation is in accordance with the NPC.   A set of configurable business rules for de-conflicting National requests for a NATO or (other Nationâ&#128;&#153;s) National resource. In absence of a conflict, such requests will continue to be honoured on a First in First Out basis (or iaw extant SOPs). (Configurability would be required based on specific operations, phases, nodes or modes.  NSPS Rules should be used in conjunction with a set of tools providing: *Improved visibility (near-real time) of throughput and stocks *Analysis and forecasting for capacity, throughput and impact of delaying selected logistics resources or requirements  When National and NATO Chains intersect (APOD/SPOD) and National supplies need to be transferred to NATO Transport, NATO priority Supply Priority (potentially combined with RDD) should drive the prioritisation. This also has a potential to allow for re-prioritisation at intermediate Nodes to balance the effect of any delays incurred up-stream in the SC.  Priorities for Logistics Resources and Requirements will be allocated (in case of NATO assigned resources) and monitored as part of the main processes: *LOG_2.3.2 Coordinate, synchronise and de-conflict Strategic Leg Movements - Movement requests submitted by Nations (in LOG_2.3.2.2 Submit Movement Request, with NATO priorities allocated)) will be prioritized by AMCC (OLCM_1.4.10.3 Prioritise Slot Requests and Allocate Slots), and allocated slots coordinated with the port operators. *LOG_2.5.4 Perform Onward Movement and LOG_2.3.2 Coordinate, Synchronise and De-conflict Strategic Leg Movements:  Movement requests submitted by Nations (LOG_2.3.2.2 Submit Movement Request) will be prioritized by JLSG HQ (OLCM_1.4.10.4 Prioritise Requests and Allocate Intra-theatre NATO Transport), coordinated with the providing unit/agency and CC HQ. *LOG_1.6.6 Request/Agree NATO Coordinated Provision of Supplies/Servicesâ&#128;&#147; requests for NATO coordinated supplies are prioritized by JLSG (OLCM_1.4.10.2 Prioritise Requests and Allocate NATO Common Items/ Supplies), in the context of LOG_1.3 Replenishment of Supplies/Services, based on the previously assigned NSPC.  *LOG_5.6 Perform Repair and Recovery *LOG_3.2 Provide MILENG Support to Logistics *LOG_6.2.1_Coordinate and Prioritize HNS *LOG_4.2 Contract Management and Coordination  ; Use Case 1 Prioritise Transport Flow at Congested Node   Ability to prioritize flow/handling of transportation assets through a congested Node (examples of LOC node choke points: Base Entry Points, Border Crossing Point (BXP))and handle backlogged LOC.   Assets may contain single priority bulk or multiple priority items.  '''Example Problem'''  Sustainment vehicles entering a NATO base undergo security checks before they are allowed to enter.   A 2 day backlog of vehicles has developed due to the limited throughput of the check facilities.    '''OLCM solution'''  Incoming vehicle consignments visible from NSE consignment visibility lists are crosschecked with JLOC priorities (identified through Mission Essential List/RIL)"

National DDPs will include the following details for each NRF CJSOR unit:  *Number of personnel.  *Equipment deployed to include any details affecting its transportation  *Ports of Embarkation (POEs). In addition, the plan is to contain details of sustainment (e.g. DOS) and the nationally/shared assured access to strategic lift, allocated to the mission to meet the CRDs. Any additional requirements for strategic lift are to be entered as generic assets and requested separately from AMCC.  b.    Based on detailed JTFHQ information (manning, required camp facilities,...) provided by JFC HQ and the Commanders Required Date for installation of the JTF HQ and JLSG HQ, JF HQ is to send the DDPs for the different elements of the deployable JTF HQ and JLSG HQ, including the NATO equipment HQ support and supplies to AMCC confirming POEs and DOA.  c.    The CCs (LCC, ACC, MCC, SOCC) will forward their DDPs to AMCC (or this will be done through the supporting TCN) so that a complete strategic lift plan can be created.  d.    On receipt of all DDPs, the AMCC will coordinate and deconflict all DDPs for the IRF into a MNDDP (Multinational Detailed Deployment Plan). The DDPs for the RFP will be kept separately in order to include them into the MNDDP upon SACEURâ&#128;&#153;s decision. Possibilities for shared use of strategic lift are to be identified to assure maximum use of scarce transportation assets.  e.    AMCC will then convene an Initial Movement Planning Conference (IMPC) with all CCs, HQs, nations, authorities and agencies involved to develop the plan as follows based on COM JHQ DOA:  *Confirm and negotiate changes to national DDPs required to achieve deconfliction and the most efficient deployment plan to meet CRDs.  *Identify and address potential for shared use of resources.  *Confirm that there is no duplication in use of limited assured access arrangements and identify an accurate requirement for the minimum additional strategic lift required to deploy the NRF to meet the CRDs.  *In order to reduce costs and to improve deployment and sustainment coordination, NATO will further develop the concept of cooperative use of strategic lift assets. All organisations with a coordinating capability, i.e. NSPA, Movement Coordination Centre Europe (MCCE, Eindhoven, NLD) and Athens Multinational Sealift Coordination Centre (AMSCC, Athens, GRC) will support this approach. In order to facilitate the contracting of the strategic lift, AMCC may request a TCN to act as Lead Nation for contracting the required strategic lift. Technical Arrangements (TAs) will be established between the Lead Nation and each of the TCNs participating in the shared use of the contracted lift. NSPAAMSA could be requested to make the necessary arrangements for the lift of the equipment and personnel of the NATO HQs.  *The AMCC will then distribute the MNDDP for the IRF to the JHQ and participating Nations. Be aware that a draft MNDDP might be distributed after the IMPC, but this will definitely change many times until the NRF deployment actually commences.  '''Upon activation of a real operation during the stand-by phase of NRF'''   JHQ staff will, as a part of the OPP, receive the Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s requirements as to which of the NRF forces are required and where, when and in what order (DOA). This additional SOR information, combined with the forces already declared by TCNs and decisions as to what PODs the NRF is to use, gives the nations the ability to construct a DDP for the real operation, to source it and to send it to"

(UBPM v2.1)  '''UBPM v2.1 and LCP UOR v2.0''':   The purpose of Phase 6 - Transition is to coordinate the transition and termination of a NATO military operation; this involves the handover of responsibility to proper authority (e.g. the UN, other IOs (e.g. EU) or indigenous actor) in the crisis area and the withdrawal of forces under NATO military command, in a controlled manner so as to avoid this action being a destabilising influence in the region.   '''UBPM v2.1''':  Throughout the execution phase of an operation, periodic operations assessments will be conducted to evaluate the progress made towards the desired objectives and the NATO end state; eventually SACEUR will conclude that the MSOs have been achieved and, with consideration to the overall conditions of the NATO endstate to which military efforts contribute, will recommend to the NAC that planning for transition and termination of the NATO military operation should commence. This phase covers all the activities for the transition and termination of a NATO military operation to facilitate the transition of NATO military responsibilities to proper authority and the withdrawal of forces under NATO military command.   Depending on the situation transition and termination planning for transition may involve activities to facilitate the coordination and management of the transition and withdrawal within the construct of the current strategic and/or operational OPLANs; alternatively, appropriate operations planning activities may be needed, involving some or all of the activities described in Phases 2-4 and leading to a new or revised NAC-approved transition strategic CONOPS or OPLAN.  As the exact moment for transition may be difficult to define, Phase 5 and 6 are likely to overlap.  The commencement of Phase 6 requires: a NAC decision sheet to begin preparation for transition and withdrawal of NATO forces under military command, with SACEUR and/or COP direction and guidance; or SACEUR (and/or COP) direction and guidance to commence considering the issues associated with a future transition and withdrawal. Each situation will be different; the NAC guidance and direction may necessitate commencing with a strategic assessment (including military considerations), proposal of military options, a transition CONOPS or a revised/new OPLAN. This activity will be supported by the most recent Operations Assessment of the operation (e.g. PMR) In the former case, the planning processes specific for phases 2 to 4b will be triggered, leading to the development of appropriate products for the NAC, as requested, leading to their approval of a revised or new strategic OPLAN (e.g. strategic assessment, military options, transition CONOPS and/or transition OPLAN).

The first part is &#34;Phase O3a: Mission Analysis&#34; which consists of an in-depth analysis of the crisis situation to determine the operational problem that must be solved and the operational conditions that must be established. It identifies the key operational factors that will influence the achievement of those conditions, and any limitations on the Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s freedom of action. The main outcome of Phase 3a is the Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s initial operational design, with the Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s planning guidance, and the Operational Planning Guidance (OPG) to formally trigger the Mission Analysis at the component level.  Upon receipt of SACEURâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Planning Directive, as part of the process OLCM_2.12 Logistics Contribution to Operational Estimate, the Operational LOG SME will conduct a thorough review of strategic guidance and a detailed logistic analysis of the mission and operational factors that will influence mission accomplishment. Information collected up to this phase will be included in the Operational Planning Guidance (OPG). The OPG will provide guidance to subordinate and supporting commands to assist their planning.  The main Information Products are *the Mission Analysis/Logistics Input used by process JOPG / Analyse Mission which will integrate it into the OPG/ Mission Analysis. *Logistics Contribution to the Initial Force Estimate and C2 Requirements used by process JOPG / Estimate Initial Force/Capability and C2 Requirements which will integrate it into the OPG/ Initial Force/Capability Estimate.  Coordination. As part of this process, the Operational LOG SME will coordinate with the following:  (1). RDG and Strategic Log Planner:  *(a). To coordinate and receive information on relevant national and international actors. *(b). To confirm the requirements for enabling and initial entry forces. *(c) to provide required input to JOPG's review of SACEURâ&#128;&#153;s direction and guidance and requirement to prepare and deploy an OLRT.  (2). NSPA. â&#128;&#147; to pass on logistic requirements in order for them to investigate possible contracted solutions.  (3). JLSG and Component Commands â&#128;&#147; To help identify and assess logistic requirements  (4) NATO Log Planners - for their early engagement in the multinational solutions development  (5) OLRT - to consider their feedback in the Mission Analysis  The main logistics activities are:  OLCM_2.12.1 Review Key Logistic Factors - The Operational Log SME will provide required input to JOPG's review of SACEURâ&#128;&#153;s direction and guidance and requirement to prepare and deploy an OLRT; they will conduct further analysis of the key factors developed in phase 2, review the SPD to check for changes to the strategic appreciation of the key strategic (PMESII) factors contributing to the crisis, and update the Operational Logistic estimate based on new information available. Activities will include: *Review SACEUR direction and guidance. *Determine milestones and key issues for consideration by the cdr. *Further analysis of information collected in Phase 2, updated with recent information and based on new guidance. Examples: consider the environment, weather, infrastructure assess the capacity of the staging area etc. *Provide logistic input to Key factors analysis  OLCM_2.12.2 Conduct Time/Space/Force analysis - The JOPG and the Operational Log SME have to consider the effects of the operational environment on the main actors as well as NATO forces as they interact Time, Space and Force.  OLCM_2.12.3 Coordinate with Relevant National and International Actors - The Operational Log SME must capture potential multi-national and host nation support solutions and coordinate with IOs/ NGOs.

'''LCP UOR v2.0''':  Operational Phase 3 â&#128;&#152;Operational Estimateâ&#128;&#153; has two parts. The first part is Phase 3a (Mission Analysis) which consists of an in-depth analysis of the crisis situation to determine the operational problem that must be solved and the operational conditions that must be established. It identifies the key operational factors that will influence the achievement of those conditions, and any limitations on the Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s freedom of action. The main outcome of Phase 3a is the Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s initial operational design, with the Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s planning guidance, and the Operational Planning Guidance (OPG) to formally trigger the Mission Analysis at the component level.  Upon receipt of SACEURâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Planning Directive the Operational LOG SME will conduct a thorough review of strategic guidance and a detailed logistic analysis of the mission and operational factors that will influence mission accomplishment. Information collected up to this phase will be included in the Operational Planning Guidance (OPG). The OPG will provide guidance to subordinate and supporting commands to assist their planning."

The Key Logistics Activities at JHQ Level:  Triggered as part of Initiate Operational OPLAN Development: *OLCM_2.16.1 Preliminary Deployment Planning - Joint Logistic Support Group (JLSG) and JHQ movement planners will meet, after the force generation conference, to review and coordinate strategic movements, together with SHAPE and  national movement planners, based on the force flow in the provisional CJSOR Triggered as part of Plan for Command and Control: *OLCM_2.16.2 Review Logistic C2 Requirements Planning - Based on the CONOPS description of the C2 arrangements required to conduct the operation, on the force package and further planning by subordinate / supporting commands, the Operational Log SME in coordination with JOPG will further develop specific aspects of the C2 arrangements, including those to consider the multinational nature of the forces from all contributing nations and the necessary arrangements for coordination with non-NATO entities.  *OLCM_2.16.3 Plan for Transfer of Authority (TOA) - Focusing on M&amp;T matters and RSOMI operations, the Operational M&amp;T Planner should confirm the level of authority required for the employment of each force in the force package against each nationâ&#128;&#153;s FORCEPREP message and further establish precisely when, where and under what conditions TOA should occur. Triggered as part of Plan Force Preparation and Sustainment: *OLCM_2.16.4 Review Requirements for Logistic and Military Engineering Support to the Force in Theatre. - Review requirements for logistic and military engineering support to the force in theatre in order to ensure that forces required to mount and conduct operations are fully capable of meeting mission requirements. *OLCM_2.16.5 Plan Logistical Support to the Force in theatre     - detailed planning and coordination is required with troop contributing nations (TCNs) and HN(s) as well as subordinate/supporting commands to ensure that supplies and services can be delivered to the force to meet operational requirements for each phase. *OLCM_2.16.6 Plan for the Rotation of HQs and Log Personnel and Forces - Requirements and initial plans to replace HQs and forces should be developed considering the likely tempo of operations and the possibility to adjust force levels over time. Triggered as part of Plan Force Deployment: *OLCM_2.16.7 Review the Requirements for Planning the Deployment of Force - coordinate movement and transportation issues with functional staff. The Operational planner should focus on the availability and access to specific facilities, infrastructure and ground transportation Units. Specific deployment requirements must be established for each force in the force package identified in the AFL, according to the final force flow, including the following: *i. Strategic lines of communication and entry points into the theatre. *ii. timing and sequence of arrivals *iii. Priority for sequence of movement (Priority is set to allow de-confliction at PODs.) *iv. Command authority to be transferred. *OLCM_2.16.8 Plan M&amp;T Support to the Force in Theatre - The Operational M&amp;T planner will focus on the availability and access to specific facilities, infrastructure and ground transportation Units and will coordinate with the subordinate/supporting commands to meet operational requirements for each phase. . In addition, he should provide TCNs with directions and guidance to coordinate with HN(s). Any shortfalls in HN support may require the activation and deployment of additional logistic units or the utilisation of contracted solutions. Use of operational deployment simulations tools will help to identify chock points and shortfalls. *OLCM_2.16.9 Design and Develop the Theatre Movements Architecture - The design, development, implementation and control of movements architecture within the theatre is a JHQ and JLSG responsibility. The logistic element of an OLRT plays a critical role in reconnaissance of movement infrastructure and coordination with the HN, as well as with relevant international actors operating in the area, for the use of facilities and LOC. The JOPG, in close coordination with the OLRT must confirm with the HN, as early as possible, the availability and capabilities of the following infrastructure: *(1) APOD/SPODs and other key transportation nodes such as railheads. *(2) Staging areas and facilities required for operational entry into the JOA. *(3) Reception areas and facilities. *(4) LOC to and within areas of operation.   Coordinate with the Allied Movement Coordination Centre (AMCC) to assist in deployment planning with nations as well as with the host nation(s) : *OLCM_2.16.10 Confirm the Force Flow - The AFL provides the information regarding force capabilities and limitations, including any caveats on employment, as well as their support requirements needed to develop the plan. Operational planning by the JFC focuses on the deployment and logistical support of forces within the theatre and their operational employment in JOA. The JFC assists the development of ADL from the AFL. The ADL establishes the time-phased flow of the individual forces that comprise the force package into the theatre and to their final destinations in their designated areas of operations, including final air and sea ports of debarkation as well as the transfer of command authority to the gaining NATO force commanders.      *OLCM_2.16.13 Establish Command Authority and M&amp;T Responsibilities for Deployment - The Operational Log SME will support the JOPG in establishing specific requirements and responsibilities for the conduct of specific aspects of deployment operations *OLCM_2.16.12 Plan for RSOM and Sustainment - further plan for the RSOMI and sustainment operations in close coordination with the theatre logistics commander (e.g. COM JLSG HQ) *OLCM_2.16.17 Develop NATO DDP - Operational Log SMEs will develop the DDP for the JTF HQ. *OLCM_2.16.11 Coordinate Detailed Deployment Plans with Nations - Deployment planning is typically conducted with nations at the strategic level, but is heavily reliant on operational requirements provided by the JOPG (M&amp;T and Log SMEs) representatives during a series of Movement Planning Conferences, attended by SNs, HNs, relevant NATO HQs and appropriate civil transportation experts and planners from the Transportation Planning Boards and Committees   As part of Coordinate Operational OPLAN for Approval and Handover: *OLCM_2.16.21 Develop LOG support to NATO Force - During OPLAN development detailed planning and coordination is required with TCNs and HN(s) as well as subordinate/supporting commands to ensure that supplies and services can be delivered to the force to meet operational requirements for each phase. The log support concept should include multinational logistic support and commercial support solutions  OLCM_1.2.2 Configure OLCM Capability -- once the planning matures (starting with CONOPS development and culminating with the OPLAN) the JFC/ J4 staff will perform the OLCM Capability Configuration. The baseline for this configuration is provided by:  *1. The Generic OLCM Capability Configuration managed by the process OLCM_1.1 Maintain Core OLCM Capability;   *2. the initial Setup (reference and core logistics Information) performed during the earlier stages of the OPP (OLCM_2 Provide Logistics Collaborative Planning for Operations)   The Operation Specific Roles, MoEs and Thresholds, Event Types and Thresholds, Alert Types and Thresholds will be configured by J4 Staff based on the main planning products: *OPLAN/ Annex R - for Logistics C2, OLC Templates (Sustainment parameters, Priorities/ Mission Essential Equipment and Supply Chain Timelines), Logistic Reporting and Visibility *OPLAN/ Annex S - for Nodes and Modes, Movement Visibility and Reporting requirements *OPLAN/ Annex B - for C2 structure *OPLAN/ Annex OO - the Operations Assessment will include Logistics for the   Measures of Efficiency and associated thresholds which will be used for the configuration; these parameters will be re-visited and updated as necessary during Execution.  These products, together with the ADL, MNDDP, RSOM Plan and OPLAN Service Support Concept contribute to the development of the Initial RLP and provide the planning baseline to start monitoring the execution. In order to set up a proper baseline for the logistics event monitoring during execution, a series of business rules will need to be configured for the following purposes: *to define triggers for logistic events *to determine the related events for a given Logistics Event,  *to define triggers for alerts and computation rules for determining their severity *to determine possible response actions to an event  *to evaluate the Logistic MoEs and compare evaluated them with the associated thresholds and generate Logistic Events  ENB_8.2 Create and Respond Logistics RFIs. Operational Log SME (JFC) will develop RFIs and respond to external RFIs and will liaise with the JOPG RFI Manager for this, which in turn will liaise with the JOC, as the coordinating authority for all incoming and outgoing RFIs     The Key Logistics Activities at JLSG Level:     *OLCM_2.16.14 Contribute to Deployment and Sustainment Planning at Operational Level - The JLSG HQ will Review the Requirements for Planning the Deployment of Forces and, in coordination with JFC, will design, develop, implement and control of movements architecture within the theatre *OLCM_2.16.15 Develop RSOM and Theatre Distribution Plan - The JLSG will assist in the detailed development of the RSOM plan and, at a time decided by the operational commander,  assume responsibility for the in-theatre central database  *OLCM_2.16.16 Contribute to Movement Conferences  *OLCM_2.16.18 Develop JLSG HQ DDP - the M&amp;T section prepares the deployment plan for the JLSG HQ.  *OLCM_2.16.19 Develop Sustainment Plan for RSOM Enablers - JLSG must develop a sustainment plan that meets the logistic requirements. JLSG logistic units need to be deployed early in order to be able to support. The support requirements need to be incorporated in the RSOM OpOrd. *OLCM_2.16.20 Produce RSOM Op Order - Based on the JF COM OPLAN, the de-conflicted MNDDP, requirements of deploying forces, HNS Agreements and JLSG force package capacities &amp; capabilities, JLSG HQ has to develop an OpOrd which has to contain direction and guidance for the subordinated units, NSEs and units undergoing RSOM .  '''LCP UOR v2.0''':  Operational OPLAN development is an iterative, collaborative process (with subordinate and supporting commands, as well as with cooperating relevant national and international actors) that focuses on synchronising and coordinating the deployment, employment, protection, support and sustainment of the operational force during different phases of the operation within a single operational level plan.   The Operational Log SME will ensure that required operational resources, capabilities and supporting activities are coordinated and arranged to facilitate operational success for the JFC Commander and subordinate commands within the JOA. The JOPG will focus on operational level planning requirements associated with deployment timelines, sustainment and operational lines of communication.   Phase 4b concludes with SACEURâ&#128;&#153;s approval (and the Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s promulgation) of the operational OPLAN and the approval of the plans of the Component Commands."

                           description="; OLCM_2.17 Execution  '''UBPM v2.1''':  Operational Planning Within  JFC HQ/ ICE/ JTF HQ *a) The focal point for planning in the JFC HQ is the J5 Branch together with the J3 (Effects &amp; Influence). These branches are generally in charge of understanding and assessing the unfolding operation in order to be able to recommend and/or issue further planning amendments as necessary in a timely manner. *b)Generally, J5 deals with planning kinetic and non-kinetic actions while the J3 (Effects &amp; Influence) would focus on the desired and undesired effects of such planning activity. Therefore, a close relationship in terms of planning and coordination must exist between the two branches. *c) The J 35 (Synchronization &amp; Execution Section is the other major player in terms of execution planning and sequencing. This section, through the Joint Coordination Board (JCB), maintains the joint campaign on the planned path and periodically produces a Joint Coordination Order (JCO) or FRAGO in close coordination with J5 and J3 (Effects &amp; Influence), as and when required. The focal point for all activity is to ensure that the operation remains on track or can be returned to track as per the OPLAN. *d)  J5 will look at three main horizons and J5 personnel will be allocated to the task by the Branch Head and may range from the full JOPG to a Crisis Action Team as considered appropriate.  *e) The J5 taking into account the campaign level assessment process, maintains its responsibility for the coordination and production of contingency planning throughout a given operation; to include the continued development of CONOPS, OPLAN, SUPLANS, Branches &amp; Sequels and D&amp;G. The main responsibity of J5 is to develop future plans in the long term horizon. During the Campaign synchronization J5 supports J3 in the development of current plans as required, which remain a J3 responsibility. In short term horizon, J5 establishes a close coordination with the ICE IOT monitor current operations. In particular J5 and the JOPG will support the execution of current operations by: **1. monitoring the execution of the campaign and recommend conditions for the transition within the phases **2. producing relevant planning directive and guidance to include sequels for subsequent phase if required **3. developing additional branch plans or review the existing ones, for the current phase to respond  to any potential â&#128;&#156;what ifâ&#128;&#157; in order to redirect the operation back to the planned track. Normally this activity is conducted within the Battle Rhythm and in close coordination with the Assessment Board/WG and the Joint Coordination Board WG (Ref. AD 80-70). *f) The JF HQ or the ICE (when established) are responsible for the monitoring and analyzing the current situation (0 to 72 hours timeframe) within the constraints of the OPLAN and the COMâ&#128;&#153;s current supplemental guidance. The operational focus for these Centres is on determining the â&#128;&#156;what isâ&#128;&#157; the situation for COM.  Planning Horizons  In summary, within the JF HQ there are 3 different time horizons under which the JF HQ/ ICE or JTF HQ (when established) will manage, coordinate and synchronize the mission. The levels of planning team involvement range from the full JOPG to smaller teams within J5. For some situations or short notice events Crisis Action Teams (CAT) may be the most appropriate way of dealing with a planning need while some aspects of Joint Time Sensitive Targeting (JTST) or Joint Personnel Recovery (JPR) may best be dealt with in the ICE or JTF HQ (when established) or by the appropriate CC. While the normal 3 planning horizons will be sufficient for most missions, events may drive the situation within each of the 3 horizons, but a more immediate event may require the ICE to plan at very short notice.  Logistics Staff maintains responsibility for monitoring logistic actions during the execution phase. JFC Staff will monitor the logistic situation ensuring the harmonization effort between military and civil actors and  will coordinate with SHAPE Support Logistics to fill operational logistic shortfalls. Logistics activities at operational level during Execution phase include: JTF J4 *OLCM_2.17.1 Coordinate Logistics Advice within JTF HQ - Co-operate closely with representatives in the J5, J3/5 and JAB.

Throughout the execution phase of an operation, periodic operations assessments will be conducted to evaluate the progress made towards the desired objectives and the NATO end state; eventually after concluding that achievement of strategic military objectives is approaching and, with consideration to the overall conditions of the NATO end-state to which military efforts contribute, SACEUR will recommend to the NAC that planning for transition and termination of the NATO military operation should commence. This phase covers all the activities for the transition and termination of a NATO military operation to facilitate the handover of responsibility to proper authority (e.g. the UN, other international organisations (e.g. EU) or indigenous actor) in the crisis area and the withdrawal of forces under NATO military command, in a controlled manner so as to avoid this action being a destabilising influence in the region. Depending on the situation, transition and termination may be able to be managed within the construct of the existing strategic and operational OPLANs; alternatively, appropriate operations planning activities may be needed, leading to NAC approval for a specific transition strategic CONOPS or OPLAN. As the exact moment for transition may be difficult to define, Phase 5 and 6 are likely to overlap.  The commencement of Phase 6 requires: a NAC decision sheet to begin preparation for transition and withdrawal of NATO forces under military command, with SACEUR direction and guidance; or SACEUR direction and guidance to commence considering the issues associated with a future transition and withdrawal.  Logistic Activities during the phase. The JOPG LOG planner will assist in planning the transfer of authority and re-deployment of NATO forces. Specific Logistic Tasks during this stage (Note: logistics tasks corresponding to Phases 2 to 4b are not repeated here). *Coordinate with relevant non-NATO actors within the engagement space. *Provide logistics input in developing the Re-Deployment plan. This process will be similar to the step taken in previous stages to include mission analysis, operational design, and concept development. *ensure there is continuous logistic support when developing the transfer of authority (TOA) of NATO owned infrastructure *The process dealing with OLC Capability closure is OLCM_1.5 Close Operations Logistics Chain Capability: At the end of an operation, the corresponding OLC Capability will be closed: the physical logistics chain will be de-activated,As part of this process, the following activities are performed at Operational level: *OLCM_1.5.1 Manage OLCM specific Mission Data - information collected for the operation will be analyzed and archived, analysis results might be used to re-configure the thresholds for various parameters.

The catalogue also contains general information including POCs and reference information including relevant STANAGS and Allied Joint Publications and relevant national regulations and procedures.  Each capability shall be available as part of a list (by type or by nation for example) and as a graphic displayable on a map and appropriate map areas can be designated for a specific mission.   The graphic items shall support access to metadata (in a pop-up window or similar) related to the item (for example a warehouse may have total capacity and available capacity data associated with it). HN declarations of availability are also able to be captured.  The overlaid data effectively provides a â&#128;&#152;recognized HN Pictureâ&#128;&#153; to assist planners."

                              description="'''Develop Concept of Requirements'''  A COR is developed which addresses the broad functional support requirements for the mission or training exercise. It aims to scope the overall level of support required for the mission and is developed in consultation with sending nations, accounting for NATOâ&#128;&#153;s own needs as well as those of the nations.  It includes outline requirements land, air, maritime, security, transportation, telecommunications, facilities, etc., providing the HN with a list of the required types of support. The COR is an overview document which doesnâ&#128;&#153;t include details regarding the timing and quantity of the required support.  The COR is in effect an initial SOR.  HN Catalogue items deemed â&#128;&#152;requiredâ&#128;&#153; for the mission may be tagged accordingly such that a view of the HN requirements data may be displayed, filtering out that which is not required.  '''Preconditions:'''  The NATO Commander has directed NATO formations and SNs to develop outline COR(s) at the Initial Logistic Planning Conference (ILPC). The COR is based on the CONOPS and accompanies it. The initiation of CONOPS development is a necessary precondition to the development of the COR.  '''Basic Flow:'''  *1. Logistic staffs of the relevant Allied Force, commanders and SNs conduct preliminary site surveys within the HN (if/as authorized). *2. The strategic HN planner develops the COR with input from nations. *3. The strategic HN planner submits the COR to the HN, copied to the NATO  Commander.  *4. The HN identifies shortfalls against the COR(s) and discuss these with the appropriate NATO Commander and SNs.  '''Alternative Flows:'''  The preliminary site surveys might occur in the form of a thorough review of the respective HNS Catalogue.  '''Postconditions:'''  An agreed COR is available to accompany the mission CONOPS and conditions are in place for the development / signature of the NATO/HN TA. Exceptions: Time constrains, small exercises etc. may see this step omitted and a SOR developed directly.  '''Assumptions:'''  Based on the COR a Technical Agreement (TA) will be drawn up between the Operational Commander (carried out by his J4 staff) in consultation with SNs and the HN.  HN Requirements should be visible alongside Force and other Requirements (including Logistic Support requirements) to ensure appropriate consideration is given by all parties to the appropriate sourcing and provision of mission capability across the spectrum."

Scenarios seek to facilitate analysis of how best to accomplish assigned mission tasks and satisfy target and collateral constraints. The CRE capability will produce different estimates for different scenarios. Elements that describe a possible scenario are: * Mission Type â&#128;&#147; Drives attrition rates. Examples: Article V Operation, Non Article V Crisis Response Operation, Defence against Terrorism, Peace Keeping, etc. [AJP-3.4(A), 2010] * Enemy Profile / Threat Assessment / Attrition or Engagement Types (to inform Casualty Clusters) / Battle Environment (Rural, Jungle, Urban etc.) * Operational Event Profiles (to drive clusters) * Mission Phase * Physical Environment (if shown to be applicable)  ; Force Structure A mission â&#128;&#152;Forceâ&#128;&#153; is made up of its Force Structure which is hierarchical and is required in order to identify the number, size and type of operational units for the purposes of calculating a CRE. Each force has a given PAR and Forces which include subordinate units will have a PAR equal to the sum of their subordinate's PARs. TOPFAS supports the force generation in the Operational Planning Process and the CRE capability shall be able to import the ORBAT (Order of Battle) and Statement of Requirements (SOR) force structure generated in TOPFAS. The force structure shall specify: * Combat Units (Type/size and number â&#128;&#147; e.g. 2 x Combat Brigades) * Combat Support Units (CSU) (type/size and number) * Combat Service Support (CSSU) (type/size and number) * Set relationship between units (parents, subordinate) * Other population(s) â&#128;&#147; Civilians will be included for applicable mission types  The CRE capability shall also be able to construct or modify a force structure using basic force element approach (add, edit, delete force elements) or a more rapid force builder approach (select from pre-defined force structures, grouped into the following categories:  ground manoeuvre forces, naval forces, and air forces.).  The Capability Codes (CC) and Capability Statements (CS) provide the common â&#128;&#156;languageâ&#128;&#157; used in Defence and Operations Planning in order to express capabilities. [NCIA TR-2013-SPW008899-01] provides more information about Defence and Operations Planning and [NAC AC/281-N(2011)0178 (R), 2011] provides CC and CS used as ACO Force Standards and/or Combined Joint Statement of Requirements (CJSOR); these could be used as input for building the force structure.  ; Mission phases A joint operation normally consists of a number of stages (or phases) starting with preparatory activities (pre-deployment), continuing with deployment and conflict and ending with post conflict. The aim of staging an operation is to maintain continuity and tempo and to avoid unnecessary operational pauses.  Stages are sequential but they may overlap and it is likely that casualty rates will vary during the different phases of an operation [NATO AJMedP-1, 2009]. Users with appropriate permissions shall be able to use the CRE capability to model any stage of an operation and they shall be able to configure parameters for the different operational stages and to generate casualty rates accordingly.   ; Time Interval Casualty Rates are generated for a specific category (e.g. unit, phase of the operation), for a certain PAR and for a defined time interval (days, weeks, months). The casualty rates can be calculated on a per-day basis (e.g. day 1 â&#128;&#147; 0, day 2 â&#128;&#147; 1, etc.) or aggregated for the entire time interval considered. The system shall allow users with appropriate privileges to configure a timeline for which casualty rates will be generated."

                              description="CBRN environment and scenario characterisation inputs are used to determine the initial exposure, or quantity of CBRN agent or effect, associated with each icon. Adjustments to this amount are then made for each icon to estimate the final dose/dosage/insult received by individuals at each icon. The calculations that are required to estimate this adjusted value depend on both the type of the agent or effect and the various parameters specifying the interaction between the individuals and CBRN environment, the characterisation of the use of warning and response, and the physical protection. For example, the availability of physical protection may reduce an individualâ&#128;&#153;s final dose/dosage/insult value. These final dose/dosage/insult values are then an input to the next phase of the methodology, namely â&#128;&#156;Human Response Estimationâ&#128;&#157;.  In the methodology the following factors are specified to estimate the final dose/dosage/insult values: *Exposure factors such as breathing rate, and activity level. *Shielding factors which provide a passive form of protection against CBRN agents and effects. For example, for aerosolized chemical and biological agents, the air exchange rate associated with the chosen building or vehicle type is used in the ventilation shielding factor calculation. *Characterisation of warning and response process: In [NATO AMedP-8(C), 2011], warning is defined as a command-approved statement that a CBRN attack is likely, is about to occur, or is presumed to have occurred. Response is defined as the associated decision to take one or more mitigating actions; the mitigating actions themselves are considered in separate components of the dose/dosage/insult calculation methodology. For the characterisation of the warning and response, the user should determine both the availability within the scenario, and if available the time at which it occurs. This time is user defined and may be tied to scenario-specific events such as the time the first individual is exposed or the time at which some percentage of the individuals within the scenario become ill. In all cases, warning and response should be measured from the beginning of the attack. *Characterisation of the use of physical protection: Physical protection is the active use of physical barriers to prevent or reduce exposure to CBRN agents or effects. The methodology distinguishes between physical protection (initiated by command decision and typically triggered by warning) and shielding, which is an inherent characteristic of an icon related to its location."

According to the methodology described in [NATO AMedP-8(C), 2011] if an individual is considered a casualty at the time an injury due to a causative agent or effect first exhibits a specified â&#128;&#156;injury severity levelâ&#128;&#157; .  For all agents and effects, the input to the human response component is the dose/dosage/insult calculated in the previous phase. Given this estimated dose/dosage/insult, the type and severity of an individualâ&#128;&#153;s injury (i.e., the human response) can be estimated which to determine the casualty status of individuals over time.  Although the methodology can be generalized as described above, three different approaches are taken in this phase depending on the type of agent or effect. * One approach is to estimate human response to chemical and radiological agents and nuclear effects. In this approach, the output is a set of composite injury profiles based on the dose/dosage/insults received by individuals. * One approach is to estimate human response to non-contagious biological agents.

This is the domain of strategic and operational level planning staff. *Operations which may occur in the future (â&#128;&#156;a missionâ&#128;&#157;). This is within the realms of contingency planning and the NATO defence planning process.  NATO planning is conducted at all levels, i.e. from the North Atlantic Council down to the operational level, including consultations at the tactical level. The Comprehensive Operations Planning Directive (see [ACO COPD, 2013]) describes the military aspects of operations planning as the responsibility of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe. He is responsible for developing Military Response Options (MROs), delivering the strategic Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and the strategic-level Operations Plan (OPLAN).  Appropriate CONOPS and OPLANs are also developed at the operational level and below and the operational-level contributes towards the development of many of the strategic-level planning products, including the Combined Joint Statement of Requirements which is the vehicle for determining which forces will be required to deploy in support of the mission. It is developed iteratively with the CONOPS and OPLAN.  Together these planning products address the availability and capability of facilities and resources which may be available to the mission commander. In the medical domain these include the availability and quality of host nation logistic infrastructure, facilities and related medical capabilities, options for contracting the support of third parties and the availability of military medical capability. While the early phases of planning emphasises the gathering of available information, later planning phases begin to address the required mix of forces and capabilities to meet the operational requirement. At this point a wide range of factors are examined as part of a detailed mission analysis and theatre requirements begin to take shape.  It is during the development of feasible MROs and the detailed analysis of the selected MRO when the MSSC is likely to be of greatest use. It will allow for an assessment of relevant factors, gathered and developed during the operational-level â&#128;&#152;Phase 2â&#128;&#153; to contribute directly the mission analysis in the operational-level â&#128;&#152;Phase 3aâ&#128;&#153;. The MSSCâ&#128;&#153;s utility may also extend into the development of courses of action and the data generated may contribute directly to the production of the CONOPS."

                        description="Maintain Health Surveillance includes Disease Surveillance, EpiNATO and Force Health monitoring processes.  The Force Health Status process is continuous. There is an ongoing background activity to develop and maintain the National Prophylaxis library as a point of reference for operations planning and for assessing the readiness of units assigned to missions and on standby as part of the NRF. As seen in Figure 3, NATOâ&#128;&#153;s Operations Planning Process includes, up to and including Phase 4b at the Strategic Level, the process of Force Generation. As units are assigned to a mission, specific readiness information may be sought from nations into the Operational Unit Prophylaxis database and compared with the nationâ&#128;&#153;s standards in the library to assess medical readiness and as a contribution to the Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s risk assessment. The immunization coverage against diseases of the units participating in an operation can further be taken into consideration during Casualty Rate Estimation (CRE). That same data capture and assessment may be carried out for units assigned to the NRF. Extra operation-specific prophylaxis information can be provided by a nation beyond the items found in the reference library for that nation.  As the FHSC system gets filled with prophylaxis data, a set of querying, analysis and reporting capabilities will enable the commander and other associated stake holders to gain further insight on the force readiness and incurred risks for the operation from a health perspective. Longer term benefits will be supporting trend analyses, force health protection KPI calculation and gathering lessons learned. These capabilities will be able to be invoked either using text-based forms or from a map view. Also, relevant geo-referenced query results can be pre-configured and exported to the MEDICS layer of the NATO COP tool.  Apart from the mainstream processes described above, two other processes are to maintain a BW countermeasures library and a reference information library. The system will enable the willing nations to report on their countermeasures against BW agents. Lastly, all other reference information deemed relevant to FHS such as STANAGS, standards, recommended readings, disease symptoms, diagnosis, treatments, vaccination and medicine information, dosage, side effects, adverse effects, disease surveillance and medical intelligence and the like will be compiled into the FHS Reference Information Library. Only links to the sources will be provided whenever possible and the content otherwise.   Finally, an administrative process run by the system administrator will regulate the maintenance of the lookup values, names of operations, regions, countries, diseases, application groups and the like."

                        description="The Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) Process is drafted here as a generic description, based on an example mission thread definition for Forward Aeromedical Evacuation.   Note that some nations use the term Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC).  NATOâ&#128;&#153;s medical doctrine defines MEDEVAC as the movement of patients under medical supervision to and between Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs).  MEDEVAC is a fundamental aspect of medical support. Movement of casualties is not just transportation to a suitable MTF but is part of a continuum of patient treatment and care, and is therefore, a medical responsibility. At no point in the chain of evacuation must the level of care be reduced below that received at the previous MTF.  '''A typical sequence of events''' for Forward MEDEVAC: * A casualty occurs at the Point of Injury. * The casualty is reported to a Tactical Operations Centre (TOC). If the respective unit does not have appropriate organic assets to evacuate the casualty, support is requested from higher echelons in the chain of command. * The Theatre Headquarter (HQ) that controls the evacuation assets  ** tasks the appropriate unit to conduct the MEDEVAC,  ** determines the most appropriate MTF  ** and coordinates with all involved actors during execution of the MEDEVAC mission. * The evacuation unit moves to the Point of Injury (or a different, agreed pick-up point). * The evacuation unit evacuates the casualty to the determined MTF and communicates with the MTF to provide best possible preparation of the MTF. * During the whole process, the position of involved actors is tracked, where possible, for situational awareness and effective coordination The mission thread context of an Aeromedical evacuation is illustrated in the figure below.  [[image:Medevac_context_Fig9.JPGâ&#128;&#142;|MEDEVAC context, Aeromedical method]]  '''Stakeholders:''' * Casualty unit * Evacuation Unit * Evacuation Team  * Evacuation Coordinating Officer  * Evacuation Liaison Officer  * Patient Evacuation Coordination Cell * Medical Treatment Facility  '''Information Products needed (input):''' * status of medical (treatment) facilities:  ** location ** the specialist capabilities available and staffing levels,  ** medical equipment status,  ** current bed occupancy status and any surgical backlog.  * status of evacuation assets:  ** Location,  ** availability,  ** medical equipment status * status of patient:  ** location,  ** The clinical condition of each patient, and any special medical requirements during or after movement; Adequate and complete medical records must be kept on each patient during the entire evacuation process and retained in the patientâ&#128;&#153;s permanent medical record.  The Force Commander's medical staff must at all times have access to relevant data about the health of the command, and the assets available/needed to provide optimum care. Other Operational Relevant Medical Data is also needed, and should be accessible by the MedCIS, including: * Maps of the Area of Operations (AOO); * MTF locations (grid references) and connectivity means (phone and fax number, etc.) * Host Nation Support MTFs (location, phone, fax, capability, comments, etc) * Airfield â&#128;&#147; helicopter pad characteristics in the AOO (location, phone, length, operation hours, etc.) * National Support Element (NSE) (location, phone, fax, comments and remarks, etc.)  Situational Awareness: The current tactical situation and any risk in moving patients or using valuable evacuation assets.  In order to direct appropriate assets, reduce response times and have direct communications, an overarching communication plan must be in place, exercised and tested periodically. The Theatre Medical Director coordinates this plan.  The Theatre Holding Policy is a command decision indicating the maximum length of time (days) that a patient will be allowed to remain in the theatre for treatment, recovery and return to duty.  The medical evacuation process is supported by the tracking process. The tracking process will provide the following information: * Who is the patient? * When was the patient status changed? (This will apply on admission, on transfer and on discharge) * Where is the patient currently located? * What is the patientâ&#128;&#153;s destination (in case of transfer)?  '''Systems support'''  The MEDICS Patient Tracking System (PTS) is to: * Support mission participants with an overview of the location of the patients within the multinational medical support chain; * Contribute to the Common Operational Picture; and * Serve as the basis for Patient Regulation.  A PTS should be near-real-time, accurate and dynamic, using standardized procedures and involving HQs J1 staff.  A national PTS is any national system that is dealing with the location of patients. For every nation there shall be only one point of data exchange at any time. Alternate points of data exchange are allowed only for the case of communication problems using the primary point.  An integrated PTS will offer in-transit visibility of patients and is one of the bases for Patient Regulating."

'''Request RFI with Medical Interest'''  According to [NATO AJMedP-3, 2008] the Medical RFIs are requests for additional medical information to access and evaluate a specific issue. Medical RFIs are submitted by the Intelligence Branch to a higher headquarters on the basis of a medical intelligence staff or experts analysis. In the MEDINTEL capability, RFIs with medical interest are submitted by users with the RFI submitter role. They are received by users with RFI manager roles and these users shall be responsible for validating RFIs, assigning units for actions and ultimately delivering a finalised medical intelligence product.  '''Manage Tasks'''  The purpose of managing tasks is to coordinate the work involved in producing medical intelligence products. Collecting medical information should be seen as a dynamic process, with agencies or sources being tasked to provide relevant input. The collection may be used for the primary medical assessments as well as for a follow-up intelligence course of action during the operation. A user with MEDINTEL Information Manager role shall create tasks related to the RFI with medical interest. These tasks are overseen by a user with Task Coordinator role; this role shall manage the execution of the task and shall submit the finalised MEDINTEL product to the information manager.  '''Create MEDINTEL Products'''  The production of medical intelligence is a joint effort between the medical intelligence and intelligence communities working in a close relationship to ensure Medical Intelligence specifics are included in overall intelligence requirements and production plans [NATO AJMedP-3, 2008]. The medical community will provide medical expertise and specialist analysis and advice, and the intelligence community will lead on the formulation of overall intelligence requirements and production plans, based upon commanderâ&#128;&#153;s intent and support to operations, as required. The MEDINTEL capability shall support the members of both INTEL and MEDINTEL communities in creating products in a collaborative manner. This means that different medical intelligence experts shall work on different parts, sections or chapters of the same medical intelligence product, in line with their assigned roles and responsibilities.  '''Collect Medical Related Information'''  Medical related information (such as alerts and observations) may be obtained through a variety of open and public sources and all personnel may have the opportunity to identify and gather medical information. Direct observation of facilities during visits represents important medical information that can be of value to MEDINTEL analysts. The MEINTEL capability shall allow users with relevant roles and permissions to submit information obtained in the way described here, in a format compatible to [NATO STANAG 2481, 2001]. The end goal is to integrate such information into the intelligence threat assessment for the commander in support of operations."

                              description="The Exercise specification development process will enable the OCE, together with the TA and supporting organisations, to plan and prepare the exercise. The single major deliverable in this stage is the Exercise Specification (EXSPEC).  Basic Flow of Events:  (1) Review Foundation Documents: These should provide common understanding within the EPG, and provide the required foundation/inputs for the EXSPEC development.  (2) Develop Exercise Aim and Objectives: The EPG will develop the exercise aim and objectives, mainly based on these foundation documents, with inputs from the OSE staff and respective TA HQs.  (3) Determine Participation Requirement: The EPG must determine those HQs and forces (when not yet prescribed by MTEP) that are required to accomplish the aim and exercise objectives. The composition of own forces, as well as in-theatre forces should be clearly identified with respect to whether real, generic or mixed real/generic forces will be used. This step should refine the TA and requirement for specific Response Cells (RCs).  (4) Establish the Optimal Level of External Actors (EA) partner nations and relevant IOs/GOs/NGOs Participation: The MTEP will establish the outline planned level of partner participation. The EPG should coordinate with the MPD, SHAPE J9 and SHAPE CIVAD to ensure EA partner nations are involved as early as possible in the exercise process in accordance with NATO policy. The OSE OPR should ensure that the NATO documents required for release to partners participating in the exercise are identified and released as soon as practicable according to extant rules and procedures3. For a LIVEX this includes the determination of the requirement for a Pre-Exercise quality Threshold Evaluation (PETE). The requirement should be stated in the electronic Partnership Real time Information Management and Exchange system (ePRIME). Appropriate IO/GO/NGO representation is essential in order to represent the comprehensive operating environment. In order to attract respective IOs/GOs/NGO organisations, a benefit for these organisations needs to be created. In order to achieve that, it can be necessary to create training value for them. Therefore, the inclusion of IOs/GOs/NGOs could have implications for training objectives and scenario development.  (5) Determine External Support Requirement: The EPG should establish the requirements for external support to be requested from other NATO HQs and/or agencies.  (6) Confirm Host Nation Availability: The Host Nation(s) (HN(s)) should have been identified in the MTEP. The OSE OPR must confirm the ability of the HN(s) to host the exercise and arrange for OSE and OCE 3 MC 554/1, Military Committee Policy for the Development and the Implementation of the Whole Potential of the Operational Capabilities Concept within a More Operational Partnership, 5 December 2007. visits as required in sufficient time to preclude cancellation of the exercise.  (7) Develop the Outline for the Use of Operational Networks and Command and Control Information Systems (C2IS): The EPG should determine the integration and use of NATOâ&#128;&#153;s deployable command and control information systems as well as supporting partnersâ&#128;&#153; participation.  (8) Develop Exercise Type Alternatives: The MTEP will have established the exercise Type and Form. The EPG should consider alternative types which would best support the requirements.   (9) Develop Exercise Concept Options: This step is designed to determine how best to design and conduct the exercise in order to accomplish the exercise aim and objectives. It will establish which stage III (Operational Conduct) phases are to be conducted, how to sequence them and how to employ exercise resources.  (10) Determine Setting: Based on analysis of contingency planning priorities and priority planning situations, as well as likely risks and threats, the EPG should offer recommendations and seek decision on the use of real or fictional geography, keeping in mind possible political sensitivities. The JWC managed Bi-SC Scenario Inventory Database provides an inventory of available settings/scenarios.   (11) Conduct Initial Exercise Site Survey(s), Liaison and Coordination Visits: The OSE OPR will determine the requirements for, assign tasks and coordinate for site surveys, liaison and coordination visits conducted by or under the responsibility of the EPG. The first site survey is organised by OSE with OCE, ODE, PTA and HN participations. The first site survey confirms the exercise locations. Host Nation confirmation will be requested.  (12) Determine Costs and Update/Develop Initial Budget Submission: The initial budget submission should be updated based on the exercise concept options and level of participation with the associated costs. The requirement for recourses to support costs of non-NATO participation and supportive security arrangements needs to be determined.  (13) Present Exercise Concept (Options) to OSE for Decision: The OSE OPR will coordinate the time and place to brief the OSE on exercise design options for decision and, with the support of the EPG, present options and recommendations, as well as any requests of further guidance on issues to be developed.  (14) Determine Evaluation Requirements. The EPG should determine requirements for evaluations to be conducted during the exercise. If so, these need to be reflected in the EXSPEC, and a DIREVAL needs to be assigned.   (15) Determine Analysis and Experimentation Requirements: The EPG should determine requirements for both analysis and experimentation. If so, these need to be reflected in the EXSPEC. (a) OSE analysis requirements may be submitted to HQ SACT Lessons Learned Branch for inclusion into the JALLC Program of Work or any other suitable analysis organisation. (b) For NATO exercises, HQ SACT provides/coordinates experimentation requirements; decision on integration of experiments, which remains an OSE decision, should be taken not later than the Initial Planning Conference (IPC). Integration of experiments into exercises should not interfere with the achievement of exercise and training objectives.  (16) Develop Scenario Module 1 - Geo-Strategic Situation: The Geo-Strategic Situation Module is prepared by the EPG and should include: a generic description of the crisis area, the major regional actors, a summary description of the current crisis, and the historical background of the crisis, as well as the major political, military, economic, cultural, humanitarian, and legal conditions that support a NATO military response. The Geo-Strategic Situation is summarised in the EXSPEC main body and expanded in an EXSPEC Annex."

                              description="The Requirements and limitations analysis process analyses and determines the requirements from the TA (C2 requirements, training requirements standing crisis planning requirements) and exercise  organization ( Exercise control requirements, c2is integration requirements, real life support).  Basic Flow of Events:   (1) Review EXSPEC: The CPT conducts a mission analysis based on an analysis of the EXSPEC and other references.  (2) Establish Training Audience HQs C2 Requirements: Consider any further development of the C2 arrangements to be exercised.  (3) Develop Operational Requirements for Planning Situation/ Scenario: Based on the analysis of the mission essential tasks to be exercised, the Commandersâ&#128;&#153; Conference proposal and TO conditions the exercise must create, the CPT should articulate further operational level requirements that must be met by the exercise planning situation.  (4) Determine IERs and Develop IER Matrix: For all phases of the Operational Conduct Stage the CPT must determine three basic categories of Information Exchange Requirements (IERs) and Functional Services (FS) requirements during the Planning and Product Development Stage; those to be used by the non-deployable Training Audience, those to be used by the Deployable Forces TAs and those required by the EXCON and its supporting elements. Close coordination between the CPT IER/FS members and the OCE OPR is required in order to stay within the given budget and other administrative limits. The product of this exercise process step should be identification of the NCIA support, TA HQs and other assets required to support all three categories IERs and FS requirements during each exercise phase/sub-phase of the Operational Conduct Stage. CIS conditions listed in the TOs should be satisfied first.  (5) Non-Deployable Training Audience IERs and FS Requirements: The non-deployable TA HQs should have HQ-specific standing crisis management plans that specify the IERs and FS requirements for real world crisis situations. For a real world crisis situation it is expected that the IERs and FS requirements in the standing plans based upon the static HQs ACO Fielded System Baseline2 would be updated by the responsible HQ IER/FS specialists during the crisis response planning. The CPT should analyse the IERs and FS requirements specified in the standing plans with respect to the envisioned exercise IERs and FS requirements to determine and document any modifications or additional IERs and FS requirements required for the TA participation in the exercise.  (6) Forces HQs IERs and FS Requirements: Each of the deployable TA HQs should have a generic crisis response plan with IER and FS requirements templates that would be modified to produce real world IERs and FS requirements in the event that the HQ is tasked to join and/or support a real world NATO Deployed Forces (DF) operation. These IERs should be based upon, among other things the Minimum Military Requirements (MMRs) for Deployable Forces C2 to achieve interoperability between NATO and National C2 systems to facilitate common situational awareness3. For a real world crisis situation it is essential that the generic crisis response plan IERs and FS requirements based upon the deployable HQs ACO Fielded System Baseline are updated by the responsible DF HQ IER/FS specialists during the crisis response planning. The CPT should compare the generic crisis response plan IERs and FS requirements with the MMRs and with the IERs and FS requirements envisioned by the CPT to establish the C3 systems and capabilities that will be required to accomplish the DF HQâ&#128;&#153; mission essential tasks.  (7) Exercise Control IERs and FS Requirements: The CPT should for each exercise phase/sub-phase determine both the EXCON operational IERs and FS requirements, including requirements of the evaluation, analysis and experimentation teams; and the IERs and FS requirements related to EXCON interaction with the TA. This category also includes the IERs and the FS related to interfacing with the TA command and control information systems. Early determination of IERs and FS requirements is important. Full utilisation of IER/FS subject matter experts (SMEs) from the ODE and other supporting HQs, agencies and centres is essential to ensure that the EXCON IERs and FS requirements are identified and planned for, in order to ensure a realistic interaction between EXCON and TA, and to reduce any negative impact on the CIS of the TA.  (8) Determine C2IS Integration Requirements: C2IS in peace HQs will normally be operating on a NATO Secret (NS) Wide Area Network (WAN) during exercises. Deployable Forces HQs will operate on a NS WAN and/or on a Mission Secret (MS) WAN. The CPT should ensure the appropriate subject matter experts, including NATO CIS Services Agency (NCIA) representatives, determine the C2IS Integration Requirements for the exercise, taking into account among other things, the availability, training fidelity, costs, and benefits of use of both NS and MS WANs.  (9) Determine Pre-Operational Conduct Training Requirements: Based on its analysis of the TOs as well as the Operational and Training Assessments provided by the OCE and TA, the CPT will determine and prioritise requirements for pre-Operational Conduct training. Examples of such training for HQs range from simple â&#128;&#152;warm upâ&#128;&#153; exercises before the Sub-Phase IIIB for single HQs to a more structured pre-exercise training period for multiple HQs using the ACO Fielded System Baseline CIS and with a MEL/MIL designed as a lead-in to the Sub-Phase IIIB STARTEX.  (10) Consider Pre-LIVEX Combat Enhancement Training (CET) and Force Integration Training (FIT) Requirements: Although conduct of CET and FIT is primarily a national responsibility, the CPT should initiate identification of potential CET and FIT requirements to reduce potential conflicts with training audiencesâ&#128;&#153; participation in the LIVEX phases/sub-phases.  (11) Refine Evaluation Requirements: The CPT will review exercise requirements for evaluation and determine the need for the OCE, in consultation with the OSE, to identify individuals to support the DIREVAL in the development of the Evaluation Plans.  (12) Refine Analysis Requirements: The CPT will review exercise requirements for analysis and determine the need for the OCE, in consultation with the OSE to identify individuals to support analysis efforts in the coordination of the Analysis Plans.  (13) Develop Experiment Integration Requirements and Limitations: Early engagement by the HQ SACT Operational Experimentation Branch and the JWC Joint Capability Integration Division is essential when experiments are to be conducted during the exercise. Due to the nature of the experimentation concepts and tasks the exact form of operational experiments to be conducted may not be finalised until late in the EP. This does not absolve planners from ensuring close links with each other to ensure that mismatches do not occur between the exercise aim, exercise objectives, the TOs and the collective experimental requirements. For NATO exercises, experiments will be accommodated to the fullest possible extent but they will always be subordinate to the achievement of exercise and training objectives. When required, CPT, on behalf of the OCE, will request JWC or JFTC to assign an Experimentation Integrator. The Experimentation Integrator will be responsible for the integration of experiments and development of the Experimentation Annex to the EXPLAN. Costs of incorporation of experiments into an exercise will be monitored throughout the exercise process and will be allocated under the â&#128;&#156;costs lie where they fallâ&#128;&#157; NATO funding principle.   (14) Determine Initial EXCON Requirements: Based on the EXSPEC and OCE guidance the CPT must determine the EXCON requirements, and take note of the evaluation and analysis team participation, given the TA C2 arrangements and exercise locations. The CPT will consult with the ODE, if designated. If no ODE has been designated the EXDIR will be consulted.  (15) Establish Modelling and Simulation (M&amp;S) Requirements and Constraints: The CPT should determine initial M&amp;S requirements based on the PTA mission essential tasks to be exercised, the TO conditions, and the C2IS employed by the TA. Although normally only associated with providing SYNEX support to Command Post Exercises (CPXs), M&amp;S tools can play a role in all types and forms of exercise. NATO has a wide range of M&amp;S tools that should be considered for the OCE to develop the scenario modules and to deliver exercise data in the proper formats and granularity to provide the best training for the TA. Some Bi-SC Automated Information System (AIS) Functional Services such as TOPFAS and LOGBASE4 can also be used by the EXCON as M&amp;S tools in designing the scenario or in war-gaming potential events/incidents and their supporting injections. The use of M&amp;S tools by EXCON must be transparent to the TA.  (16) Assess M&amp;S Tool Options and Cost/Benefits. Care must be taken to identify the M&amp;S solution for the exercise that best will ensure that the exercise aim and objectives are achieved. New scenarios with complex in-theatre forces and fictional geography may require the development of M&amp;S databases with long lead times. Computer assistance for developing, managing and delivering the MEL/MIL injections can enhance a CPX with little additional resource expenditure. M&amp;S can ensure a consistent time/space/force/ information representation of a complex scenario, as well as provide an automated feed of information in the proper formats and levels of granularity to the C2IS employed by the TA. However, caution must be taken when the M&amp;S tools supporting the Opposing Force (OPFOR) simulation also are providing the OPFOR â&#128;&#152;ground truthâ&#128;&#153; to TA situational awareness Functional Services, such as the TAsâ&#128;&#153; common/recognised operational pictures, as it is unlikely that the TA would have the same fidelity of information for an actual operation. Special consideration should be given to the use of M&amp;S to support data generation to appropriately represent the comprehensive operating environment. The synchronisation of M&amp;S and C2IS requires on time planning to ensure that technical interoperability is set and the connection is authorised. Employment of a tailored M&amp;S solution can also reduce the required number of personnel in the EXCON structure and is highly recommended. Cost/benefits analyses should be conducted to identify the best M&amp;S tools package for the exercise.  (17) Determine Operational CIS Requirements and Constraints. Analysis of the operational CIS requirements should be based on the TA C2 arrangements as well as EXCON requirements during the entire exercise. The CPT CIS member should advise on the availability of organic systems and maximum Points of Presence (PoPs) that can be supported as well as any costs for leased CIS. Rental and/or acquisition of CIS is possible if Deployable CIS (DCIS) assets or NCIA CIS services are not available and if eligible for NATO funding (eg; in compliance with in STANAG 5048 for NATO land forces).   (18) Determine Real Life Support (RLS) Requirements. RLS requirements for exercises will vary from minimal (eg; for exercises that take place within own HQs of the participants) to moderate (eg; for exercises where some HQ elements are deployed in the field or to a training centre) to extreme (eg; where HQs and forces deploy for LIVEX). The CPT should assist the Logistics member and their own HQ Support Group SMEs in determining preliminary requirements based on venues and the level and scope of participation at deployed locations, including for EXCON.  (19) Determine Deactivation Requirements for Exercise Sites. The CPT should determine requirements for deactivation of all exercise sites after each appropriate phase/sub-phase. These requirements should include redeployment of all participants as well as NATO and troop- contributing national assets and completion of all contractual claims, environmental tasks and actions.  (20) Determine Budget Requirements and Eligibility. The OCE Exercise Fund Manager will review and further develop budget requirements and funding eligibility with the CPT for different functional areas such as CIS, RLS, HNS, White cell, SIMPRESS, etc. When the exercise and all connected events have been approved in the respective partner programmes, funds will be allocated for the exercise.  (21) Submit Draft Initial Exercise News Release (IENR) to the OSE. After agreeing the requirement with the OSE, the OCE PAO is responsible for developing, in close coordination with the host nation, the draft IENR. The draft IENR must be submitted to the OSE at least four weeks prior to STARTEX of the Operations Conduct phase or the intended IENR date, whichever is earlier. Subsequent release authority may be delegated to the OCE. If the exercise is likely to be special political considerations or other sensitivities the IENR will need to be processed earlier to allow time for additional staffing potentially up to the NATO MC level. See Chapter 6 of the ACO Public Affairs Handbook."

Basic Flow of Events:  (1) Develop Guidance on Missions, Forces and Tasks: The guidance should be based on the OSEâ&#128;&#153;s aim and objectives taking OCEâ&#128;&#153;s intent, constraints and limitations into account as well. It should describe OCE desired flow of the exercise and the missions and tasks to be planned and/or executed by the TA during the exercise. The OCE desired exercise flow will be the basis for the detailed exercise design required for further scenario development.  (2) Provide Further Guidance on TA Command Arrangements: This guidance to the CPT should ensure the scenario is designed to allow freedom of action for the TA to design an operational C2 structure and command arrangements appropriate for the mission and mission essential tasks to be exercised during the different exercise phases/sub-phases.  (3) Provide Guidance on Scenario Development: The OCEâ&#128;&#153;s scenario guidance should focus on further describing those essential strategic and operational conditions that the scenario must establish in order to exercise the mission and essential tasks in an environment and conditions that conform to the TAâ&#128;&#153;s most likely or most challenging potential employment options.   (4) Provide Direction for Use of Operational Networks and C2IS: The CPT should include, in the OCEâ&#128;&#153;s Exercise Planning Guidance, direction for use of operational networks and C2IS based upon: the C2IS integration requirements determined during the first CPTM; the decision on use of NS and/or MS WANs; the determination of the operational CIS requirements and constraints; and the analysis of the three basic categories of IERs and FS requirements; those to be used by the non-deployed TA, those to be used by the deployed TAs and those required by the EXCON and its supporting elements.  (5) Provide Guidance on Pre-Operational Conduct Training: This guidance to the CPT should cover all pre-Operational Conduct EXCON training for each Exercise Phase. The training programmes to be referenced in the EXPLAN should include individual and collective training requirements for EXCON specialised tools, as well as the training requirements for EXCON use of Bi-SC AIS Functional Services. If appropriate, the guidance should include pre-Operational Conduct training for members of the evaluation and analysis teams participating in the exercise. If desired, the guidance may also address some pre-Operational Conduct training requirements for TA commanders and staff. However, the TA HQs will remain responsible for individual and collective training of their own commanders and staff.  (6) Provide Guidance on Pre-LIVEX Combat Enhancement Training (CET) and Force Integration Training (FIT).  (7) Provide Guidance on Evaluation Requirements and Analysis Objectives: The OCE and representatives of the participating evaluation teams and each HQ planning analysis activities during any exercise phase/sub-phase shall examine the ACO evaluation requirements and planned analysis objectives to ensure they fit within the scope and scale of the exercise without compromise to the exercise aim, exercise objectives and TOs.  (8) Provide Guidance on Experimentation: The OCE Experimentation point of contact in cooperation with the HQ SACT Experimentation Venue Coordinator and/or JWC/JFTC Experimentation Integrator will review the experiments and new concepts planned to be conducted during the exercise as approved by the OSE. The purpose is to make sure that any possible new developments regarding approved experiments will not interfere with the exercise aim and objectives and the training objectives. Any potential issues will be resolved between the OSE OPR and OCE OPR.  (9) Provide Guidance on EXCON: The OCE guidance on EXCON should address organisation, manning, training, RLS-issues and reflect exercise design, scenario, TA C2 structure, etc.  (10) Provide Guidance on Modelling and Simulation Tools: The OCE M&amp;S guidance should address M&amp;S requirements and resources including manpower, hardware/software, networking and databases.  (11) Provide Guidance on the Use of Deployable CIS and AIS: This should focus on achieving the MMRs for Deployable Forces C2 to achieve interoperability between NATO and National C2 systems to facilitate common situational awareness, NATO and national C2 information, and tracking of forces during all phases of the operations. It should address requirements for integrating Bi-SC AIS Functional Services and ensure the availability of requisite theatre and force data.  (12) Provide Guidance on the Use of Deployable Equipment: Requests for usage of the deployable equipment shall be directed to SHAPE. Taking into account the training objectives, the OCE OPR will submit the request to SHAPE Logistics Directorate as early as possible during the Exercise Process. The request will be balanced against real world requirements and the guidance provided by SHAPE DCOS OPS/INT on the usage of CP-0A0149, CP-5A0156 and CP-9A11015 equipment for training purposes.  (13) Develop Guidance on Establishment and Conduct of Syndicates and Additional Conferences: The CPT must identify these requirements early and ensure they are included in the EP Milestones. Insofar as practicable, exercise planning and development coordination, syndicate meetings and conferences should be conducted virtually using video-teleconferencing (VTC) or network conferencing tools. On syndicates linked to the already planned conferences in the EP the OCE should give general guidance.  (14) Develop Task Allocation and Coordination Requirements: The CPT will determine the requirements for task allocation and coordination and produce the refined milestones and coordinating instructions.  (15) Present Options and Recommendations to OCE for Approval: The CPT will have identified any issues requiring further OCE guidance as well as those that require referral to the OSE for additional direction and/or guidance. The OCE OPR will brief the OCE on the results of the CPT analysis and recommended OCE guidance for consideration and endorsement. (16) Issue OCE Exercise Planning Guidance: (This step may be skipped if the OCE is also OSE and developed the EXSPEC)."

(17) Develop HNS Requirements: These requirements should guide the Site Survey and contribute to the subsequent development of the Statement of Requirements for HNS.  (18) Allocate and Coordinate Tasks.  (19) Develop Module 3 - Strategic Initiation: The Strategic Initiation Module establishes the international and NATO political desired end-state, objectives, limitations and directions as well as the supporting strategic military assessments and planning guidance following the NATO Crisis Response System.  (20) Develop Module 4 - Crisis Response Planning Information: The Crisis Response Planning Information Module provides current updated information and data about the international and regional situation. Information and data11 are produced in accordance with ACO directives and in Bi-SC AIS Functional Services and doctrinal APP-11 series formats (where available).  (21) Deliver C2IS Database(s) for Operations Planning: The CPT should ensure that exercise data developed for the TA databases are sufficient to support operations planning. Insofar as practicable, the data should be provided by the EXCON through the standing agreements,processes and procedures that would be used if the planning situation were real.  (22) Develop Evaluation and Analysis Plans.  (23) Assemble Experimentation Annex.  (24) Issue EXPLAN: The OCE OPR will staff the refined draft EXPLAN for approval with the HQ and then distribute it.  (25) Finalise Phase I Training Package: This should include, among other things, topics for: Round Table Discussions (RTD), Panel Discussions (PD), Case Studies (CS), vignettes, practical exercises and subject matter expert presentations. Topics should be linked with appropriate Training Objectives (TO).  (26) Develop Module 5 - Force Activation and Deployment Information: Once the TA initiates Phase II, Crisis Response Planning, the CPT/EXCON will coordinate/generate the national and strategic force generation, activation and deployment information as required to enable the development and completion of the respective OPLAN. This Moduleprovides external information/data in response to player CONOPS and CJSOR, as well as player Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s Critical Information Requirements (CCIRs) as required to complete operations planning and to initiate deployment and initial entry operations. Specific products (eg; ACTORD and ORBATTOAs) may be issued prior to or during Sub-Phase IIIA. The CPT/EXCON should carefully analyse the results of the TAâ&#128;&#153;s operational, sustainment, deployment and specialised functional planning against the pre-established Sub-Phase IIIA STARTEX conditions necessary to achieve the exercise objectives and conduct war-gaming of the execution of these plans to determine the optimal STARTEX date/time for the exercise Sub-Phase IIIA. Module 5 information/ data are to be produced in accordance with ACO directives and in Bi-SC AIS Functional Services and APP-11 series doctrinal formats (where available).  (27) Develop Module 6 - Execution (STARTEX and MEL/MIL): The Execution Module describes the current situations at STARTEX for Sub-Phase IIIA and Sub-Phase IIIB, based on a careful analysis of the OPLANs against the Exercise Objectives and TOs and the OPFOR Campaign Plan as well as the likely situation in the theatre. The CPT/EXCON should carefully analyse the TA performance results of the Sub-Phase IIIA against the pre-established Sub-Phase IIIB STARTEX conditions necessary to achieve the exercise objectives to determine the optimal Sub-Phase IIIB STARTEX date/time13. All Module 6 information/data are to be produced in accordance with ACO directives and in Bi-SC AIS Functional Services and doctrinal APP-11 series formats (where available).  (28) Develop M&amp;S Theatre Data (from C2IS Data) per Strategic Guidance: Once the CPT has developed the operational data for use by NATO C2IS and the TA have developed their OPLANs to a degree that the CPT can determine those operations to be modelled and simulated to support to Sub-Phase IIIA based on Scenario Module 6, the OCE/ODE OPR can allow the designated SME to proceed with the development and testing of the M&amp;S data.  (29) Develop and Test M&amp;S Databases and Information Exchanges: In parallel with the development of scenario Module 6 Execution (STARTEX and MEL/MIL) M&amp;S SMEs will develop and test required M&amp;S data and information exchange between M&amp;S tools and operational C2IS. Close cooperation between scenario developers and M&amp;S SMEs will facilitate the required synchronisation of scenario and M&amp;S data."

Basic Flow of Events:  (1) Module 2 - Theatre of Operations: The Theatre of Operations Module is the second scenario module. It is developed from the Geo-Strategic Module produced during the Exercise Concept and Specification Development Stage and published with the EXSPEC. The Theatre of Operations Module contains static information/data about the region to support strategic assessments and operations planning. This module may consist of wholly or various mixes of real, synthetic and fictitious information/data. Information/data will be produced6 according to NATO information standards and support the use of Bi-SC AIS Functional Services. Products should be developed by the CPT in a cross-functional Operational Information Management Syndicate or Theatre Data Working Group. Products will be required prior to the CRP Initiation, which may occur before the MPC, and may be required earlier to support HQ-specific pre-Operational Conduct training events.  (2) Review Scenario Module 1 â&#128;&#147; Geo-Strategic Situation: The Geo-Strategic Situation Module published with the EXSPEC should be reviewed to ensure its coherency with the corresponding elements of the Theatre of Operations Module. This may result in scenario design refinements with respect to the use of real, synthetic, fictionalised or fictitious scenario data7. Scenario designers should select the design refinements that best comply with political sensitivities, unavailability of theatre information or other constraints.  (3) Develop Exercise Map Datasets: Information/data will be produced according to NATO information standards and support the use of Bi-SC AIS Functional Services. Geospatial information/data must be compatible with the Bi-SC AIS Core GIS Service.  (4) Develop Theatre of Operations Country Information/Studies: The country data/information should be provided in the applicable format; i.e. STANAG 2077 , Country Catalogue or as specified.  (5) Develop Theatre of Operations ORBAT Data: Select real, fictional, generic and/or mixed forces and provide data in the format and level of detail that would be available if the situation were real. The locations of the â&#128;&#152;friendlyâ&#128;&#153; forces at this point should be their home stations.  (6) Develop Theatre of Operations Infrastructure Data.  (7) Develop OPFOR Campaign Plan (for use by EXCON only)."

                              description="The Foundation training process delivers a set of individual and collective training programs to equip the TA with knowledge about the upcoming scenario, environment and systems.  Basic Flow of Events:  (1) Phase I â&#128;&#147; General outline: The allocation of responsibilities for training will depend on institutional budgeting and established programmes of work (POWs) for supporting organisations. It is important to recognise, that Phase I is not a substitute for Individual Training as described in the E&amp;T Approach, as the training focus is especial related to the needs of Phase II and III and tied to setting and scenario. The entire training calendar needs careful planning to best use limited SACT and SACEUR Command Structure resources in support of the individual and collective training requirements. Phase I may be conducted in up to four sub-phases. The number of sub-phases and their timing will depend on the type and size of the exercise. Each Foundation Training sub-phase could require its own planning process with administrative instructions, plans and steps as specified in the EXPLAN. Each Phase may vary IAW required preparation steps, but in a very generic way the following steps could be taken into account IOT plan and execute different sub-Phases.  (2) Conduct Sub-Phase IA: Internal (Individual and Collective) Training. Internal Individual and Collective Training will be conducted at the discretion of TA Commanders utilising NATO Education and Training Facilities (NETF), Centers of Excellence, Partner Training and Education Centers (PTEC) or own resources as appropriate. This is an internal training of the HQ without any support from ODE. This phase may include: Functional Area Training (FAT), Functional System Training, professional development training, Work Shops, and Syndicate Discussions. Basically this Phase should improve foundation knowledge of each staff member to perform his functional area duty in the future collective training.  (3) Conduct Sub-Phase IB: Academic Seminar. The overall purpose of the Academic Seminar is to prepare TA Commanders and their key staff for the challenges of likely operational missions, and to function as an operational HQ as planned in Phase II, Sub-Phase IIIA and Sub-Phase IIIB of the exercise. The scheduling should be de-conflicted with Phase IC to allow maximum Command Group and Key Leader participation. The Program and timeframe of this Sub-Phase IB may vary depending on the TA Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s requirements.  (4) Conduct Sub-Phase IC: Key Leader Training (KLT). KLT is individual training designed for the â&#128;&#152;Key Leadersâ&#128;&#153; under the responsibility of the PTA commander for a specific exercise venue or upcoming military operation. It is important to link the Key Leaders with their own staff taking part in academics, usually conducted concurrently, to allow the interaction using syndicate discussion and backbrief. This training usually covers presentations and discussions on the different aspects of the future operation.  (5) Conduct Sub-Phase ID: Battle Staff Training (BST). Battle Staff Training is a collective training opportunity to fulfill TA commanders requirements for the enhancement of conducting the decision making process (working groups, boards, etc.) within the HQ. The size and scope of the BST will determine which methods (i.e. vignettes, MEL/MIL) and tools (i.e. role players, mentors) are used for the achievement of the commandersâ&#128;&#153; aims. Usually it is conducted as a single level training event. The BST will normally be planned and conducted by TA Commanders within own capabilities as specified in the EXPLAN. Relationships between Phases ID, IIA/B depend on the use that is made of the CRP products (CONOPS, OPLAN) during Phase ID. A direct link between Phase ID and Phase IIIB has an impact on the whole exercise planning process3 and requires a much bigger support by external entities (i.e. JWC, JFTC). The support by ACT is established during CTS POW Process."

The documents that would be appropriate for the simulated compelling situation will be created beforehand by the OSE EPG, OCE CPT, ODE EPT and/or the EXCON. As a part of collaborative OPP, the TA should contribute to the development of their higher echelon OPP products in accordance with Chapters 3 and 4 of the ACO COPD. The TA will utilise the ACO COPD as well as other ACO directives and their SOPs to activate their appropriate HQ crisis organisations, conduct the OPP, acquire the requisite operational data and information, establish and maintain situational awareness, attain situational understanding and produce the CRP exercise phase deliverables within the applicable timeframe."

When everything is inline with the scenario the execution is started with STARTEX and will be ended with ENDEX.  Basic Flow of Events:  (1) Determine Exercise Sub-Phase IIIA STARTEX. The pre-established Sub-Phase IIIA STARTEX conditions based on, among other things, the OSEâ&#128;&#153;s aim and objectives and the OCEâ&#128;&#153;s TOs, should be applied to war-gaming of the TAsâ&#128;&#153; OPLANs and other Phase II products against the OPFOR campaign plan within dynamic theatre conditions and environment.  (2) Refine and Issue the Requisite STARTEX Documentation, Data and Information for the TA. This will primarily be found in Scenario Module 5 and in the TA products from the Phase II.  (3) Refine OPFOR Campaign Plan (for use by EXCON only). EXDIR supported by EXCON, OSE/OCE/ODE EPG/CPT and with TA OPR.  (4) Establish Training Site(s).  (5) Establish and Maintain EXCON. A small tailored EXCON will be activated to support Sub-Phase IIIA. See notional Sub-Phase IIIB EXCON organisational structure at Figure 5-2. The EXCON required for Sub-Phase IIIA of a LIVEX will be significantly different from that required for a CPX. It is important to augment the EXCON Grey Cell by HNS experts that could Role Play e.g. Master Harbour or Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure.  (6) Activate Training Team(s).  (7) Activate Evaluation, Analysis and Experimentation Team(s).  (8) Initiate and Control the Conduct of the TAâ&#128;&#153;s Force Activation, Deployment, and RSOM&amp;I.  (9) Manage the Scenario MEL/MIL/Simulation.  (10) Observe and Evaluate the Force Activation, Deployment, and RSOM Phase. Daily feedback from deployed observers, trainers and senior mentors (when employed) are used to assess the progress toward the accomplishment of exercise and training objectives.  (11) Conduct Deactivation Activities for Exercise Sites (If required)  (12) Prepare and Conduct Sub-Phase IIIA Review.  (13) Determine Exercise Sub-Phase IIIB STARTEX.

The EXDIR will ensure that the appropriate members of the EXCON refine the OPFOR Campaign Plan based upon the Phase IIIA results to optimise achievement of the OSEâ&#128;&#153;s aim and objectives and the TOs.  (15) Refine and Issue the Requisite STARTEX Documentation, Data and Information for the TA. This will primarily be found in Scenario Module 6 and modified/updated based on the TA products  (16) Provide the TA with necessary Situation Update Documentation prior of the STARTEX of PH IIIB.  (17) Establish RLS/CSS at Exercise Sites.  (18) Establish CIS Connectivity and CIS Services  (19) Activate Force Protection (FP) Plan.   (20) Implement Safety and Environmental Measures. All exercise sites must have precautions in place for real world emergencies such as fires, oil spills, medical emergencies, etc. A sequence of appropriate drills must be performed at each site prior to the start of the exercise, particularly when the exercise is conducted in underground command facilities or aboard a command ship. LIVEX safety and environmental issues are addressed in Annex Q, Live Exercises and Environmental Protection and Environmental Health Hazard Assessment Considerations.  (21) Stand-up EXCON in all Locations. IAW EXPLAN inputs including Senior Mentors and Training Teams.  (22) Conduct EXCON Training IAW EXPLAN.  (23) Deploy TA to the Exercise Sites.  (24) Conduct Warm-up at the TA Locations. This activity is done by TA IOT commence the HQs Battle Rhythm and integrate the augmentee personnel to the staff. This phase is conducted without any interaction between TA and EXCON.  (25) Activate the EXCON VOB/NMIC. The details are included in Annex I.

Friendly Forces Information Requirements (FFIRs): What the commander needs to know about own forces.   Essential Elements of Friendly Information (EEFIs): Type of friendly forces information that will compromise the mission if the enemy gets hold of it."

Harmonises the aerospace control, force application, and force enhancement roles, and integrates the efforts of the air assets of the other Component Commanders; the Air Plan is instrumental in achieving the joint objectives and desired effects; b. Identifies target sets or categories and levels of destruction or effect desired in as much detail as time and available intelligence information allows; c. Prioritises the targets that are assigned to ACC and provides an estimate on the time required to achieve the desired results and effects; d. Outlines levels of effort to be used on targets, as a basis for the apportionment recommendation; e. Indicates phasing and synchronisation of the operation; air mission phasing and synchronisation as mentioned in the Air Plan follows from the phasing and synchronisation in the Joint OPLAN;  f. Identifies the air effects that contribute to the achievement of the joint operational effects required to achieve the Joint Force Commander's End State; in addition, the means to achieve the air effects and the metrics to measure effectiveness and performance are identified.  g. Indicates force requirements necessary to accomplish the planned missions; as the requirements for each aerospace control and force application mission are determined, the level of effort is translated into the desired aircraft types and numbers; these numbers and the planned employment concepts will determine the types and size of combat force support and force multipliers."

Consequently, for SDP development, there is a requirement for coordination with subordinate level commands, international organisations, contractors and Nations, as appropriate."

The development of a MNDDP respects the following sequence: # The North Atlantic Council will direct the NATO Commands and associated civilian agencies to plan for a mission. With that direction comes the authority to coordinate operational and logistics planning. The deployment planning process begins with the definition of the concept of operations and the Statement of Requirements (SOR) needed to accomplish the task.  # The SOR defines the Force Requirement which are sent to Nations via ACTWARN, or ACTREQ messages.  An Allied Force List (AFL) shows national commitments. Nations then respond with their force commitments in Force Commitment Lists or FORCEPREPs.  Upon receipt of the National force nominations, an Allied Disposition List (ADL) is prepared by matching the commitments (AFL) against the requirements and by adding the force receiving commandersâ&#128;&#153; parameters such as priorities, Desired Order of Arrival (DOA), Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s Required Delivery Date (CRD), Air/sea Port of Debarkation (APOD/SPOD), railhead and Final Destination (FD).  The ADL is sent back to the Nations together with the Commanderâ&#128;&#153;s Planning Guidance.  # Upon finalization of the ADL, movement and logistics planners from the troop contributing nation(TCN)s prepare and develop National Detailed Deployment Plans (DDPs) in conjunction with the Broad Planning Guidance.  Nations submit their initial National DDPs to the AMCC, and subsequently, they are distributed to the relevant planning authorities for evaluation, integration, deconfliction, coordination and prioritization. # The AMCC combines these initial National DDPs into one Multinational DDP (MNDDP) which is analyzed and presented during the subsequent movement planning conferences. These movement planning conferences define, evaluate, and deconflict aspects of the movement planning process including the sustainment of forces, and identification of transportation assets and shortages. # Movement and Transportation planning is an iterative process necessitating close interaction among all deployment planning and execution authorities.  # The final product of this entire process is a coordinated and deconflicted MNDDP that supports the Operational Concept.  This MNDDP is included into the OPORD by the OPCON Headquarters in the form of a Movement Support Annex (SUPLAN)."

The ADP reflects the Jint Forces Commander's priorities. The ADP establishes broad policies and procedures for the coordination and employment of air defences as well as detailed weapons engagement procedures that are applicable to all joint counter-air operations.    Joint air defence should aim to integrate the AD capabilities of all components in order to protect and influence the battlespace in line with the campaign plan. The principles of joint air defence are: a. Denial of intelligence to the opponent to mount an attack or to complicate his targeting and control process to the extent that his attacks are ineffective. b. Obtain warning of hostile action by putting in place the means to compile and disseminate a RAP that will facilitate options for the ADC to provide an appropriate response to hostile activity. c. Defence in depth can be achieved through the integration of all air defence systems. The ADC will need to establish coordination measures related to the defensive assets by which hostile attack systems will need to be countered. The number of defensive layers will depend upon the assets available, the C2 infrastructure, the warning time achievable, the threat orientation and the disposition of the joint forces. d. Coordinated AD activity whereby subordinate regional commanders established by the ADC can procedurally exchange the RAP, air battle management information, effect weapons coordination and reduce mutual interference during operations. e. Concentration of effort by means of a coordinated AD design to gain maximum synergy out of joint AD assets and effectively counter the whole spectrum of air threat."

OPORDs are the executive instruments that may enact an Operational Plan (OPLAN), and can be produced by commanders to give detailed instructions to their subordinates. All executers of military services need to use an OPORD.   The OPORD is a standardized multiparagraph military order. In all simplicity, an OPORD is an OPLAN that has been approved for execution by the commander - which means that these two information products have the same structure.   The OPORD, Warning Order and Fragmentary Order are interpreted as one logical message, therefore their creations and uses are similar. The OPORD is often simply referred to as Order."

The identification of TAIs is the initial step in the targeting process. A Decision Point (DP) or a Decision Line (DL) must be identified for each TAI. DPs and DLs are points and lines offset in time and space from their respective TAIs where the commander must make a decision to use his assets if he is to influence the operation at a particular TAI."

Due to inherent limitations of IFF systems, the Rules Of Engagement (ROE) customarily require other forms of identification in conjunction with IFF identification before a target can be engaged. Other forms of identification to consider are Visual identification, Track origin, ESM and SIGINT, Tactical Data Links or FFT among others. The process to combine these identification sources is described in STANAG 4162[@@@STANAG 4162 @@@]."

This format is a complete description of incident and log entry data within the application. By definition, JOCWatch is both a producer and consumer of OIR. Third-party applications may also access the OIR format programmatically for their own purposes. The initial format of OIR was an XML-based flat list directly mapped to table columns. Since JOCWatch 1.5.0 the OIR format has become a structured description.  Increments to the OIR are usually introduced in response to feature changes in JOCWatch, therefore the application usually only produces OIR of the latest available version. This naturally means that older versions of JOCWatch cannot ordinarily consume incidents produced in a later version. For this reason, deployments of JOCWatch are usually managed in a top-down fashion, whereby the organisationally top-most element is upgraded first."

The repository doesn't and in most cases shouldn't be the original source and storage for identity information. Instead it relies on external authoritative identity data sources to provide identity attributes. Different attributes can be provided by different sources. The repository provides a mapping between logical enterprise level identity attributes and the source attributes stored in authoritative data sources and as a result builds coherent enterprise identity representation based on most trusted sources of identity information.  The repository is also a base for provisioning of the accounts in the systems entities require an access to. In this case such accounts are treated as identities in systems-specific contexts. Repository allows to maintain a link between these identities/accounts and the enterprise logical identities and enables data synchronization between these sources."

For example, it will have to manage web applications and web services hosted in an application server rather than virtual machines hosted in a hypervisor and they will have to work with web service messages rather than network packets.  The SOA SMC Application can be integrated with other SMC Applications for managing and controlling other C3 Taxonomy layers or they can be provided by dedicated applications. Market surveys done by Forrester and Burton suggest that the former typically provide better vertical information aggregation across layers, while the latter offer richer functionality in the horizontal SOA Platform layer.  The integrated SMC Applications should be able to provide aggregated information from underlying layers and drill up/down between them to troubleshoot and ensure agreed SLAs: * Ensure consistent performance of hosted services for all consumers (within agreed SLAs), * Ensure that no consumer can prevent other consumers from accessing services (within agreed SLAs), * Ensure enforcement of defined policies, * Detect problems before they are reported by consumers.  The SOA SMC Application should provide capabilities in the form of functions and processes for managing SOA Platform Services over the lifecycle that includes: * the initial commissioning of the services;  * ensuring service metadata are published and available to users; * ensuring services are up and running; * ensuring services are accessible and available to users; * ensuring services are protected and secure (IA and SMC overlap in this area);  * making sure that the services are operating and performing within the service level agreements parameters; * on-going service improvement;  * final decommissioning of services."

Guidance from the political, strategic, and operational levels, directs targeting. The first activity of the joint targeting process is to translate the Joint Force Commander's (JFC) objectives, guidance and intent into discrete tasks, each logically and directly related to the overall desired end state. The JFCâ&#128;&#153;s objectives, guidance and intent are conveyed to Components in the form of the JFC OPLAN and Joint Coordination Order (JCO). The JFC must clearly identify what is to be operationally accomplished and under what circumstances and parameters, including appropriate measures of effectiveness (MOE). The components must develop their own objectives, tasks and supporting target nominations that will achieve JFC objectives. This method of planning ensures that tactical operations are ultimately driven by NAC objectives."

The JTL has to be reviewed against strategic targeting guidance and national limitations and caveats. All further joint targeting activities are based upon the JTL, which is updated, as new information becomes available. Subordinate commanders will keep the JTL under constant review, and forward their own nominations and/or restrictions of targets to the JFC staff through the JTCB via the target nomination process/lists (TNL) and proposal of restricted targets list (RTL)."

These targets are designated as such by the JFC because their engagement is of a high enough priority to warrant immediate action in order to support campaign objectives. Some examples of potential TSTs could include: Mobile rocket launchers (MRLs); Mobile high threat surface-to-air missile systems (SAMs); Mobile C2 vehicles and facilities; Naval vessels, military or civilian which pose a threat and demand an immediate action to neutralize; Loaded transporter, erector, launchers (TELs); Deployed theatre ballistic missiles (TBMs); Weaponized WMD assets; Previously unidentified C2 nodes; Fixed targets; Terrorist leadership; Mobile radio/TV broadcast stations."

Control measure symbols represent control measures that can be portrayed graphically and provide operational information that cannot be displayed via icon-based symbols alone. They can be displayed as points, lines, areas or tactical mission tasks [APP-6]. Maritime control measures are used by NATO to help the maritime component commander and his subordinate commanders to direct action by establishing responsibilities and to prevent ships, units, or aircraft from impeding one another and to impose necessary coordination. They aid cooperation among forces without imposing needless restrictions on their freedom of action. In general terms, maritime control measures can be broken down into points, lines, and areas. The Maritime Reference Object Management Application support maritime control measures (reference points, special points, lines and areas) under &#34;Reference Objects&#34;, and provides world-wide management of Reference Objects as well as within Maritime Operations, which are identified uniquely in the system context. The definitions: Reference Point: A Reference Point is a geographical coordinate for a special point or a real object. They are displayed using the selected symbology. Line: A Line is a connection of at least two geographical points. It can be a polyline in any form. Area: An Area is a closed, geographical shape. It can be a circle, ellipsis, rectangle or polygon.

Bearing tracks can have only one dimension, an origin and an angle from true north.  The Maritime Track Management Application processes only point tracks, not contacts and sensor plots. It uses the term &#34;track&#34; for both one-time report for a vessel and continuous on-line reporting of a vessel by a recognised source. For example, AIS track from an AIS source, NIRIS track feed or Nations' on-line track feeds are all considered as tracks. Similarly, a report received from a Nation using OTH-T GOLD message will also be treated as a track. The contact reports received from a source are used to create a track if it doesn't exist, follow-on reports will be used to update that track. Tracks can be dropped if no update is received within a specified time period. Tracks can also be deleted by its reporting source.  World-wide track management is supported, which means all tracks detected and reported from different regions of the world will be identified uniquely in the system context. Maritime Track Management Application allows the user to create tracks based on the received track data, update them as necessary, manually correlate them if they are not automatically correlated, and delete them as necessary."

                        description="The Maritime Picture Management Application provides compiling and presenting the information related to both combatant and non-combatant maritime vessels. The functionality builds the Maritime Operational Picture (MOP), in the broadest sense, which consists of all kinds of Maritime Operational Objects available. MOP is the overall collection of the Military Picture (MP)(The collection of all recognised combatant Tracks, Vessels and relevant Reference Objects), White Picture (WP) (The collection of civilian maritime Tracks and Vessels with classification of non-combatants (merchant, fishing, pleasure, research, government etc.) and relevant Reference Objects), and other Information such as UNKNOWN and PENDING tracks, other available supportive information. The NATO Recognised Maritime Picture (RMP) is a managed geographic presentation of processed all-source contact and information data, known at a given time, from all available assets, and compiled by an assigned RMP Manager. The RMP consists of all contacts in the maritime environment, both surface and subsurface, commercial, military and government platforms and vessels. The WP is built first on the NU Domain by using AIS and LRIT data from contracted sources (as well as other NU data and sources) and then the WP information is transferred to NS Domain. The WP is then elaborated more with the information received from NATO assets.  The RMP is built on NS Domain as an operational, non-real-time, geographic presentation of recognised surface and subsurface units, forces, and operations. The RMP is one of the components of the NATO Common Operational Picture (NCOP). The Maritime Picture Management Application allows the user to create, query, and retrieve current and historical information of underlying data (e.g. tracks, vessels, figures, ports, special points)comprising the MOP."

The estimation of probability of detection and classification of echoes is taken into account to determine the track spacing and the number of runs per tracks necessary to complete the assigned task. For this purpose, an off-line database is used. The Sonar Performance Prediction Application enables users to retrieve Mine Hunting SONAR Performance figures for an MCM Unit to perform its task. The Application returns P(y) Curve, A and B values,  Probability of Detection (Bd), Probability of False alarm (Bfa), Probability of Classification (Bc), and False Contact Rate."

The operational environment imposes constraints and provides opportunities to adversary and friendly forces that are crucial in predicting possible adversary Courses of Action (COAs) and developing friendly COAs.  Successfully identify the dimensions of the operational environment, the extent of those dimensions, the effects obtaining from them and communicating this information with the appropriate graphical products thus allowing the commander to rapidly choose and exploit those effects that best support his mission objectives."

The medical planning is elaborated before the launch of an operation or when an operation must be reconfigured in its entirety. Knowing the forces to be deployed for a specific operation, the medical planners must estimate the casualty rate based on statistics.   Using the description of the different medical capabilities of each national military forces, the medical planners define the medical requirements (e.g. number and type of medical units, medical equipment and bed capacities as well as their location on the field) required for the global operation. The planners also perform simulation to test the &#34;what if&#34; scenarios to assess the potential impact of different medical support options and to identify shortfalls/bottlenecks in a given medical chain.  The Medical Planning Applications also enable users to certify the medical capabilities and to do the medical evaluation of multinational medical modules and units, when formed to support NATO operations Design. Therefore an interface to or incorporation of the existing medical certification tool (MEM CDI) is required. This tool ensures that after the planning phase a multinational medical chain or treatment facility (possibly including contracted medical support) meets the required medical standards.  To cover all these requirements the Medical Planning Application is divided in 5 areas, i.e. Casualty Rate Estimation (including the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear casualties), Medical Capabilities Directory, Medical Support Simulation, Medical Support Planning and a Medical Evaluation Manual"

A wiki system is usually a web application that runs on one or more web servers. The content, including all current and previous revisions, is usually stored in either a file system or a database. Text is usually written using a simplified markup language or a rich-text editor, and it incorporates special codes for the display of tables, graphs, files and pictures.   Where a native Wiki Application has limited functionality, extra functions can be added through the use of extensions, e.g. for graphic processing, mathematical functions, referencing and citations, and for the establlishment of semantic relations.  While a wiki is a type of content management system, it differs from a Blog Application or most other such systems in that the content is created without any defined ownership. And although similar to the Collaborative Workspace Application, this application typically support less functionality and is less restrictive in respect of information control. This facilitates a broader and more open collaboration and development of content. Wikis have little implicit structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users. Therefore the Wiki Application tends to rely more on continuous self-management and self-correction provided by an open community."

Information stored on or generated by this equipment act like an electronic key to access a requested resource.   Hardware Security Tokens can be further categorized into disconnected and connected tokens.  Disconnected tokens have neither a physical nor logical connection to the client computer. They typically do not require a special input device, and instead use a built-in screen to display the generated authentication data, which the user enters manually themselves via a keyboard or keypad. Some may be equipped with small keypads to allow entry of a PIN or a simple button to start a generating routine. Disconnected tokens are the most common type of security token used (usually in combination with a password) in two-factor authentication for online identification.  Connected tokens are tokens that must be physically connected to the computer with which the user is authenticating. Tokens in this category automatically transmit the authentication information to the client computer once a physical connection is made, eliminating the need for the user to manually enter the authentication information. Authentication information stored on the token may include cryptographic keys, such as a digital signature, or biometric data, such as fingerprint minutiae. In order to use a connected token, the appropriate input device must be installed. The most common types of physical tokens are smart cards and USB tokens, which require a smart card reader (typically with RFID functions or Bluetooth wireless interface) and a USB port respectively."

Inherently, the Technical Services must support all Mission Types and Operational Capabilities.  Technical Services are implemented in a federated model that allows NATO and the Nations to jointly provide a robust and secure platform on top of which powerful User Applications can be run. Thus the Technical Services provide the foundation for the NATO Network Enabled Capability (NNEC). They must implement agreed and open standards, must exhibit plug-and-play properties, and must be transparent to operational users.

An MCU is characterized according to the number of simultaneous calls it can handle, its ability to conduct transposing of data rates and protocols (transrating and transcoding), and features such as Continuous Presence, in which multiple parties can be seen onscreen at once."

Geospatial Web Map Tile Services trade the flexibility of custom map rendering for the scalability possible by serving of static data (base maps) where the bounding box and scales have been constrained to discrete tiles which enables the use of standard network mechanisms for scalability such as distributed cache systems to cache images between the client and the server, reducing latency and bandwidth use.  The service advertises the tiles it has available through a standardized declaration in the ServiceMetadata document common to all geospatial web services. This declaration defines the tiles available in each layer (i.e. each type of content), in each graphical representation style, in each format, in each coordinate reference system, at each scale, and over each geographic fragment of the total covered area. The ServiceMetadata document also declares the communication protocols and encodings through which clients can interact with the server. Clients can interpret the Service Metadata document to request specific tiles."

These standards and specifications are stored in machine readable formats that can be interpreted automatically within the service-oriented environment (e.g. XML schemas, ontologies). It gives developers and architects visibility into methods to compose and encode data and to share usage across the organization. Registration of such metadata is especially critical to achieve the data goals of interoperability and coherence by promoting semantic and structural understanding.  The Metadata Repository Services will also have the capability to maintain references to aforementioned standards and specifications, i.e. for artifacts that are managed by other registries/repositories in a federation. Metadata Repository Services provide controlled access to artifacts, the lifecycle management of the artifacts and support for proper versioning and configuration management of artifacts.

A service composition is a coordinated aggregate of services. The consistent application of service-orientation design principles leads to the creation of services with functional contexts that are agnostic to any one business process. These agnostic services are therefore capable of participating in multiple service compositions. Services are expected to be capable of participating as effective composition members, regardless of whether they need to be immediately enlisted in a composition.  There are two aspects of composition: composition synthesis is concerned with synthesizing a specification of how to coordinate the component services to fulfil the client request; and orchestration, is concerned with how to actually achieve the coordination among services, by executing the specification produced by the composition synthesis and by suitably supervising and monitoring that execution."

Orchestration describes one particular component activity of the composition that oversees and directs the other component activities. An orchestration has one and only one direction activity. In a service-oriented software solution, the component services of an orchestration are software services performed by software programs.   A service composition described by an orchestration is again a service itself and can be re-used in further compositions.  An orchestration coordinates the other sub-services in a step-wise manner, i.e. it specifies the partial order of all the steps that each of the sub-services has to do in order to produce the desired outputs in a co-operative, joined way.   An orchestration can be (and usually is) stateful as the coordination of sub-services immediately requires to keep track of states.

Choreography is a set of autonomous activities that have a defined pattern of behaviour with respect to each other. There is no single activity that directs the other activities in choreography. Choreography distributes the control and relies on the ability of its component activities to understand and respond to events. Choreography treats services as peers that interact based on an agreement, rather than imposing a single-point-of-entry brokering pattern on top of them. In a choreography scenario composition is understood as the collaborative exchange that takes place based on the description of messages exchange and the interaction of a set of services seen from a global perspective.  Choreographies are not executable in a sense that there is no central controller service that could be executed.  Choreography mechanisms are used to specify the coordination agreement and behaviour of each service in choreography, including the external interfaces exposed by the services involved and the protocol implemented by each of the services involved, including order of messages being exchanged and specification of services that these messages will be exchanged with. These interfaces of services involved and message exchange protocol followed can be used to generate stubs for the actual service implementation (e.g. to be used and exposed by orchestration).

In scenarios when usual transactional properties (like atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) are too strong or unimplementable (e.g. in complex business processes), some limited transactional properties must be satisfied to guarantee a process is not left in an inconsistent state.

The relation between the data and the information which it represents can be changed during a data format transformation. To this regard important aspects of data transformation include format conversion where data is encoded differently using another format. Both data encodings represent the same information and are usually compatible. Typical examples are the conversion of temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, or the conversion of the bit representation between Big- and Little-Endian formats.  Not all information can always be preserved during the data transformation (lossy). Reasons can be that some information is deliberately omitted and not captured in the new data (e.g. when compressing data), or that the target format is not capable of representing data in a way that the original information is completely preserved."

The remote service provider sees the request as coming from the proxy, and not from the original client. # Reverse Proxy - in this case, the proxy is handling requests from clients as if it were the server. The request is sent to the proxy, which may return a response, or may forward the request to the actual server for further processing. # Transparent Proxy - a transparent proxy acts in much the same way as a forward proxy, but the client requires no configuration to use it. As far as the client is concerned, it is communicating directly with the server, as the communications are intercepted at the network layer rather than the application layer.

Location awareness services are typically actively supported by devices using positioning systems, without the active participation of the device &#34;non-cooperative locating&#34; or detection mechanisms can be used.    Location Services in the context of networking relates to locating network nodes. These include:  * ITU switched line access addressing according to International Telecommunications Union Q-Series standards, Telecommunications Signaling System#7 (SS7) and mirroring ANSI Standards T1.110â&#128;&#148;General Information and subsequent standards. * IEEE media access addressing according to MAC International standard ISO/IEC 10038 with ISO/IEC 11802 and ANSI/IEEE edition. * ISO procedure call addressing according to URN/UUID International standards ISO/IEC 11578 and ISO/IEC 9834 and IETF RFC 4122.  Location Services in the context of geography relates to coordinates and altitude/elevation that are either relative to either a standardized system of coordinates, e.g. WGS84, or a fixed object such as a building plan. * Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) such as the United States' GPS or the European Union's Galileo use satellites to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning. It allows small electronic receivers to determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation). * Indoor positioning systems (IPS) are systems that can locate devices inside a building using lights, radio waves, magnetic fields, acoustic signals, or other sensory information. There are several commercial systems on the market, but there are no agreed standard for IPS systems. Indoor positioning systems use different technologies, including distance measurement to nearby anchor nodes (nodes with known fixed positions, e.g. WiFi / LiFi access points or Bluetooth beacons), magnetic positioning, dead reckoning."

                  description="The Communications Services interconnect systems and mechanisms for the opaque transfer of selected data between or among access points, in accordance with agreed quality parameters and without change in the form or content of the data as sent and received.   The taxonomy of Communications Services takes a generic approach, listing elementary (vice complex) communications services, as building blocks of complex, end-to-end communications services. The granularity of the services described in this taxonomy is such that even the lowest level communications service, e.g. a user typing short free-text messages on a keypad and transmitting them over a UHF satcom DAMA radio, can be represented.  The required granularity is achieved by defining elementary service blocks. These are building blocks in complex end-to-end services, as those formulated in the NSOVs of the relevant reference architectures and derived target architectures. Elementary service blocks are agnostic to the resources and solutions that service providers can adopt to implement them and can be implemented over different communications segments (terrestrial, radio, satcom), by different service providers.  By concatenating these elementary services as building blocks, service architects can streamline and specify any complex communications service, end-to-end (e.g. DCIS service). In particular: * Service blocks are concatenated to follow the flow of information, in a way similar to the actual communications infrastructure that is physically supporting the services. That makes the resulting Comms Service Maps understandable by network architects, service managers, and service providers. Comms Service Maps can be exported and used for a variety of purposes, from service level specification, to service management and control.  * Comms maps are two-dimensional representations of a complex communications service. Each service block along the chain can be assigned to different service providers, and clear interface and service delivery or service peering boundaries can be defined between them. * Service providers can select and involve the resources and the technical solutions that best meet the service level specifications for each block, under the constraints posed by the operational context, and by the connectivity/interaction with adjacent service blocks (implemented by other service providers). These constraints shall be reflected in the service level specification.  * In the NATO context, service providers can be NATO organic providersproviders (e.g. NCI Agency, e.g. providing Access Services), a NATO Nation or a consortium/group of nations (e.g. providing Transport Services and Transmission Services over military-controlled communications infrastructure), as well as commercial providers (e.g. providing Transmission Services over commercial infrastructure)."

Communications Access Services can be interfaced directly to Transmission Services (e.g. in the case of personal communications systems) or to Transport Services, which in turn interact with Transmission Services for the actual physical transport. Because they are defined end-to-end, in a comms service map, the same Access Service block can be found at both ends of the link, and will often (but not necessarily) be implemented and managed by the same service provider.  Communications Access Services correspond to customer-facing communications services. As such, they can also be referred to as Subscriber Services, or Customer-Edge (CE) Services. In most cases, they involve the direct connection of hosts or end-user devices that interface the service on a given layer of the communications stack.  The Communications Access Services nomenclature is based on the type of end-to-end access service supported between the Communications/computing devices."

                        description="The Transit Services enable the processes related to connecting IP based Transport Services together, Frame Transport Services together and TDM Transport Services together, either point to point, point to multipoint or multipoint to multipoint over metro and wide area networks. They involve the interaction of different transmission bearers of the same or different types at different nodes. These routing or switching nodes can be on the terrestrial communications segment, a terrestrial wireless segment or even the SATCOM space segment (e.g. carrier, frame or packet switching occurring on a regenerative transponder onboard the satellite payload).  Communications equipment deployed for these Transit Services (e.g. routers, switches, radio relays, SATCOM transponders, etc) may operate at different points across the core of the network. The Transit Services support standalone routing or switching elements (i.e. without attached Communications Access Services) and only connect to Transmission Services (one or more services, when routing/switching across different bearers is involved), or connect with Communications Access Services to Packet-, Frame- and Circuit-based Transport Services. Nonetheless, Transit Services are not concerned with emulated Communications Access Services or Packet-, Frame- and Circuit-based Transport Services, by virtue of the single-hop end-to-end nature of the tunnelling mechanisms supporting the virtualisation of protocols over higher-layer protocols.  Transit Services are closely associated with WAN routing/switching topologies (point-to-multipoint, mesh of point-to-point links or multipoint-to-multipoint). The topology is defined when the Transit Service is specified and will form part of the Service Level Specification (SLS)."

The second stage, involving frequency conversion, amplification, radiation, bent-pipe transponder relay, etc., will be covered under Transmission Services proper.

                  description="A communications transponder, is the series of interconnected units which form a communications channel between the receiving and the transmitting antennas.  A transponder is typically composed of: * An input band limiting device (a band pass filter) * An input low-noise amplifier (LNA), designed to amplify the signals received from the surface/ground station * frequency translator used to convert the frequency of the received signal to the frequency required for the transmitted signal * An output band pass filter * A power amplifier   Most transponders operate on a &#34;bent pipe&#34; principle, sending back of what goes into the conduit with only amplification and a shift from uplink to downlink frequency. However, more advanced radio relay stations can also perform processing, where the signal is demodulated, decoded, and then re-encoded and modulated within the radio relay station. This type of transponder , a 'regenerative' transponder, has many advantages but it is much more complex.  Transponders are part of a radio relay station. Those radio relay stations are typically part of Communications-Satellites (low earth orbit 100â&#128;&#147;1240 miles), or are mountend on High or Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE &gt; 30.000 feet/MALE 10.000-30.000 feet) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) that can stay airborne for extended durations of time, typically 24 to 48 hours."

Antennas are essential components of all equipment that uses radio and are usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. Antennas can also be used as sensor equipment.   According to their applications and technology available, antennas generally fall in one of two categories: # Omnidirectional or only weakly directional antennas which receive or radiate more or less in all directions. These are employed when the relative position of the other station is unknown or arbitrary. They are also used at lower frequencies where a directional antenna would be too large, or simply to cut costs in applications where a directional antenna isn't required. # Directional or beam antennas which are intended to preferentially radiate or receive in a particular direction or directional pattern."

                  description="A Telecommunication Cable is a type of guided transmission medium. Cables are usually known to transmit electric energy (AC/DC) but in telecommunications fields, cables are used to transmit electromagnetic waves, they are called electromagnetic wave guides. Telecommunications are based on transmitting modulated waves/signals through a medium and receiving them. When the distance between the transmitter and receiver is far, or we are using unguided medium transmission, the antennas are used, otherwise in guided medium transmission, the telecommunication cables are used.   Telecommunication cables are divided into several types: Waveguides when electromagnetic waves are transmitted; Transmission Lines when electric signals are transmitted; and Optical Fibers when light signals are transmitted.  International standard '''ISO/IEC 11801''' specifies general-purpose telecommunication cabling systems (structured cabling) that are suitable for a wide range of applications (analog and ISDN telephony, various data communication standards, building control and automation systems). It covers both balanced copper cabling and optical fibre cabling. The standard was optimized for premises that span up to 3&amp;nbsp;km, up to 1&amp;nbsp;kmÂ² office space, with between 50 and 50,000 persons, but can also be applied for installations outside this range. A corresponding standard for small-office/home-office (SOHO) environments is ISO/IEC 15018, which also covers 1.2&amp;nbsp;GHz links for cable and satellite TV applications."

A network switch is a multiport network bridge that uses hardware addresses to process and forward data at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model. Some switches can also process data at the network layer (layer 3) by additionally incorporating routing functionality that most commonly uses IP addresses to perform packet forwarding; such switches are commonly known as layer-3 switches or multilayer switches."

This device may be either a general-purpose computer running software to perform the network emulation or a dedicated emulation device which usually does link emulation.  Network emulators incorporate a varying amount of standard network attributes into their designs including: the round-trip time across the network (latency), the amount of available bandwidth, a given degree of packet loss, duplication of packets, reordering packets, corruption and modification of packets, and/or the severity of network jitter.  Those emulators may be used in situations where real network links cannot be used, e.g. during Collective Training Exercises (CTE)."

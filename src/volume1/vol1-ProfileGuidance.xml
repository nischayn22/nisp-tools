      <title>Profile Conceptual Background</title>

      <para>ISO/IEC TR 10000 <xref
          linkend="ref-iso10000-3"/> defines the
      concept of profiles as a set of one or more base standards and/or
      International Standardized Profiles, and, where applicable, the
      identification of chosen classes, conforming subsets, options and
      parameters of those base standards, or International Standardized Profiles
      necessary to accomplish a particular function.</para>

      <para>The C3 Board (C3B) Interoperability Profiles Capability Team (IP CaT) has extended the profile
      concept to encompass references to NAF architectural views <xref
          linkend="ref-naf4"/>, characteristic protocols, implementation options,
      technical standards, Service Interoperability Points (SIOP), and related
      profiles.</para>

      <para>Nothing in this guidance precludes the referencing of National
      profiles or profiles developed by non-NATO organizations in the
      NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles (NISP).</para>

    </sect1>
    <sect1
      id="v1c1-ioppurpose">
      <title>Purpose of Interoperability Profiles</title>
      <para>Interoperability Profiles aggregate references to the characteristics of other profiles types to provide a consolidated perspective.</para>

      <para>Interoperability Profiles identify essential profile
      elements including Capability Requirements and other NAF
      architectural views <xref linkend="ref-naf4"/>, characteristic protocols,
      implementation options, technical standards, Service
      Interoperability Points, and the relationship with other
      profiles such as the system profile to which an application
      belongs.</para>

      <para>NATO and Nations use profiles to ensure that all
      organizations will architect, invest, and implement capabilities
      in a coordinated way that will ensure interoperability for NATO and
      the Nations. Interoperability Profiles will provide context and
      assist or guide information technologists with an approach for
      building interoperable systems and services to meet required
      capabilities.</para>

    <sect1
      id="v1c1-iopappl">
      <title>Applicability</title>
      <para>NISP stakeholders include engineers, designers, technical project managers, procurement staff, architects and other planners.  Architectures, which identify the components of system operation, are most applicable during the development and test and evaluation phase of a project.  The NISP is particularly applicable to a federated environment, where interoperability of mature National systems requires an agile approach to architectures.</para>
      <para>The IP CaT has undertaken the development of interoperability profiles in order to meet the need for specific guidance at interoperability points between NATO and Nations systems and services required for specific capabilities. As a component of the NISP, profiles have great utility in providing context and interoperability specifications for using mature and evolving systems during exercises, pre-deployment or operations. Application of these profiles also provides benefit to Nations and promotes maximum opportunities for interoperability with NATO common funded systems as well as national to national systems. Profiles for system or service development and operational use within a mission area enable Nations enhanced readiness and availability in support of NATO operations.</para>

      <title>Guidelines for Interoperability Profile Development</title>
      <para>Due to the dynamic nature of NATO operations, the complex Command and Control structure, and the diversity of Nations and Communities of Interest (COI), interoperability must be anchored at critical points where information and data exchange between entities exists. The key drivers for defining a baseline set of interoperability profiles include:
      <itemizedlist><listitem><para>Identify the Service Interoperability Points and define the Service Interface Profiles</para>
          </listitem>

        </itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>The starting point for development of a profile is to clearly define
      the Service Interoperability Point where two entities will interface and
      the standards in use by the relevant systems.</para>

      <para>The NISP is the governing authoritative reference for NATO interoperability profiles. Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and education, Personnel, Facilities and Interoperability (DOTMLPFI) capability analysis may result in a profile developer determining that some of the capability elements may not be relevant for a particular profile. In such cases, the "not applicable" sections may either be marked "not applicable" or omitted at the author's discretion.</para>

        <title>Profile Elements</title>
        <para>Profile elements provide a coherent set of descriptive inter-related information to NATO, national, Non-Governmental Organization (NGO), commercial and other entities ('actors') desiring to establish interoperability.</para>
        <para>Profiles are not concepts, policies, requirements, architectures, patterns, design rules, or standards. Profiles provide context for a specific set of conditions related to the aforementioned documents in order to provide guidance on development of systems, services, or even applications that must consider all of these capability related products. Interoperability Profiles provide the contextual relationship for the correlation of these products in order to ensure interoperability is 'built-in' rather than considered as an 'after-thought'.</para>

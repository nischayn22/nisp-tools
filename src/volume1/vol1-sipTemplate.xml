    <title>Background</title>
    <para>Within the heterogeneous NATO environment, experience has shown that different
      services implement differing standards, or even different profiles of
      the same standards. This means that the interfaces between the services
      of the Core Services (CS) need to be tightly defined and controlled. This is the only
      way to achieve interoperability between diverse systems and system implementations.
      Recommendations for the use of specific open standards for the individual
      CES are laid down in the C3B document “CES Standards Recommendations -
      The SOA Baseline Profile” [SOA Baseline].</para>
    <para>Experience shows that while open standards are a good starting point,
      they are often open to different interpretations which lead to interoperability
      issues. Further profiling is required and this has been independently
      recognized by NCI Agency (under ACT sponsorship) and Nations.</para>
    <para>The Service Data Sheet (SDS) (for example [DEU SDS]) and SIP (for example [NC3A RD-3139],
      NCI Agency) have chosen slightly different approaches. The SIP tries to be implementation
      agnostic, focusing on interface and contract specification, with no (or
      minimal, optional and very clearly marked) deviations from the underlying
      open standard. The SDS is more implementation specific, providing internal
      implementation details and in some cases extends or modifies the underlying
      open standard, based on specific National requirements. Previous experience
      with the former CES WG while working on [SOA Baseline] is that Nations
      will not accept any implementation details that might constrain National
      programmes. Therefore, a safer approach seems to focus on the external
      interfaces and protocol specification.</para>

    <title>Scope</title>
    <para>The aim of this document is to define a template based on the NCI Agency and
      IABG proposal for a standard profiling document, which from now on will
      be called Service Interface Profile (SIP).</para>
    <para>Additionally, this document provides guiding principles and how the profile
      relates to other NATO documentation.</para>

    <title>Service Interface Profile Relationships to Other Documents</title>
    <para>SIPs were introduced in the NNEC Feasibility Study [NNEC FS] and further
      defined in subsequent NATO documents. In essence:</para>
    <para>SIP describes the stack-of-standards that need to be implemented at an
      interface, as described in the [NNEC FS]</para>
    <para>SIPs are technology dependent and are subject to change - provisions need
      to be made to allow SIPs to evolve over time (based on [NNEC FS])</para>
    <para>SIP represents the technical properties of a key interface used to achieve
      interoperability within a federation of systems (see [NAF 3.0])</para>
    <para>SIP reference documents to be provided by NATO in concert with the Nations
      (see [CESF 1.2])</para>
    <para>The SIP will not be an isolated document, but will have relationships
      with many other external and NATO resources, as depicted in the picture
      <xref linkend="SIP-docrel" endterm="SIP-docrel-title"/>:</para>

    <title>Guiding principles for a consolidated SIP/SDS Profile</title>
    <para>The following guiding principles derived from the WS-I Basic Profile<footnote><para>Based
      on <ulink url="http://ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicProfile-1.2-2010-11-09.html#philosophy"/></para></footnote>
      are proposed to drive the development of a consolidated SIP/SDS Profile:</para>
    <para>The Profile SHOULD provide further clarifications to open and NATO standards
      and specifications. This cannot guarantee complete interoperability, but
      will address the most common interoperability problems experienced to
      date.</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The Profile SHOULD NOT repeat referenced specifications but make them
          more precise.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The Profile SHOULD make strong requirements (e.g., MUST, MUST NOT) wherever
          feasible; if there are legitimate cases where such a requirement cannot
          be met, conditional requirements (e.g., SHOULD, SHOULD NOT) are used.
          Optional and conditional requirements introduce ambiguity and mismatches
          between implementations.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The Profile SHOULD make statements that are testable wherever possible.
          Preferably, testing is achieved in a non-intrusive manner (e.g., by examining
          artefacts "on the wire").</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The Profile MUST provide information on externally visible interfaces,
          behaviour and protocols, but it SHOULD NOT provide internal implementation
          details. It MAY also state non-functional requirements to the service
          (e.g., notification broker must store subscription information persistently
          in order to survive system shutdown).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The Profile MUST clearly indicate any deviations and extensions from the
          underlying referenced specifications. It is RECOMMENDED that any extensions
          make use of available extensibility points in the underlying specification.
          The extensions MUST be recommended or optional in order to not break
          interoperability with standard-compliant products (e.g. COTS) that will
          not be able to support NATO specific extensions. Extensions SHOULD be
          kept to the minimum.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>When amplifying the requirements of referenced specifications, the Profile
          MAY restrict them (e.g., change a MAY to a MUST), but not relax them (e.g.,
          change a MUST to a MAY).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>If a referenced specification allows multiple mechanisms to be used interchangeably,
          the Profile SHOULD select those that best fulfil NATO requirements, are
          well-understood, widely implemented and useful. Extraneous or underspecified
          mechanisms and extensions introduce complexity and therefore reduce interoperability.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Backwards compatibility with deployed services is not a goal of the SIP,
          but due consideration is given to it.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Although there are potentially a number of inconsistencies and design
          flaws in the referenced specifications, the SIP MUST only address those
          that affect interoperability.</para>

    <title>Testing</title>
    <para>As indicated in the guiding principles, the profile should make statements
      that are testable. An attempt should be made to make any testable assertions
      in SIPs explicit in a similar way to the WS-I profiles, i.e. by highlighting
      the testable assertions and even codifying them such that an end user
      of the SIP can run them against their service to check conformance. It
      should also be possible to come up with testing tools and scenarios similar
      to those defined by the WS-I for the Basic
      Profile<footnote><para><ulink url="http://www.ws-i.org/docs/BPTestMethodology-WorkingGroupApprovalDraft-042809.pdf"/></para></footnote>.</para>
    <para>It needs to be decided how formal testing could be organized. Possibilities
      include dedicated testing body, multinational venues and exercises (like
      CWIX) and others.</para>
